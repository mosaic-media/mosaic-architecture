# Roadmap

Derived from the real state of `mosaic-platform`, not from a plan written ahead of it.

## Where the build actually is

Twelve slices are complete. The Platform boots against real PostgreSQL, serves a GraphQL schema, runs an outbox worker with retry and dead-lettering, resolves secrets, reports component health, and shuts down gracefully with a final outbox drain. Every slice passes `go build`, `go vet` and `go test -race` against a real database.

Two further slices — uniform store resolution and its PostgreSQL follow-up — were built and then reverted under [ADR 0012](adr/0012-capabilities-do-not-own-stores.md), which found they solved a case the architecture had already ruled out.

What remains is blocked on something that was never built rather than on something half-finished.

## The critical path

Everything below is one thread. Nothing else should start until it lands, because it is the test of Mosaic's central thesis: **that a developer who is not you can extend Mosaic through the SDK.**

### 1 — The content-agnostic object model

The node tree, relation graph and per-type attribute storage. Designed in [ADR 0013](adr/0013-object-graph.md), with authority and media linking settled in [ADR 0014](adr/0014-storage-authority-and-transaction-scope.md). Not implemented.

The schema today holds identity, sessions, permissions, configuration, events, jobs, diagnostics and a blob registry — twenty-five tables, every one of them infrastructure. `object_records` tracks stored files by id, kind, location and size; it is not content. **There is no node tree and no relation graph, so a capability has nowhere to put an anime.**

This is the real blocker, and it was mistaken for something else. The reference capability was recorded as blocked on an empty `contracts/platform/v1` and a closed `Tx`; both were symptoms of building the extension mechanism before the thing it extends.

**Scope of the first slice:** `nodes`, `parts`, `relations` and `source_bindings`, their domain types and store contracts, the stores added to `Tx`, and adapter-agnostic contract tests against real PostgreSQL. Identifiers are UUIDv7 in native `uuid` columns.

**Not in this slice:** export formats, the filesystem projection, streaming, the job queue, `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, and IPTV listings. Each is a later slice and none blocks the reference capability.

### 2 — Reference capability path

Attempted twice and correctly reported as blocked rather than forced.

Its purpose changed under [ADR 0012](adr/0012-capabilities-do-not-own-stores.md). It was to prove a capability could own a store and join a transaction. Since capabilities own no schema, it should now prove what a capability actually does, shaped like the anime module the platform exists to support:

- source metadata from an external provider
- search existing content
- create nodes and relations in the generic model
- publish an event

**Exit criteria.** The proven contracts are promoted into `contracts/platform/v1` *first*, then one capability does all four using only those packages, owning no schema and touching no Platform code.

### 3 — SDK extraction readiness

Whether the contracts proven across the completed slices can leave the Platform repository as a standalone SDK a third party can build against.

**Exit criteria.** Import boundaries are enforced, and the promoted `contracts/platform/v1` surface is confirmed to expose no private Platform internals. This slice *verifies* isolation; it does not populate the surface for the first time — that happens in step 2.

### The stop point

> **The Platform is ready for SDK work when the reference capability uses only published contract packages and no private Platform internals.**
>
> **If the reference capability requires a private import, the contracts are not ready to publish.**

This is the rule to hold the line on. A private import that gets waved through is the moment the ecosystem becomes second-class — the community developer hits a wall the built-in modules never hit, and the extension model quietly stops being real.

**Steps 2 and 3 together are the thesis test.** If a capability can be built entirely against the published contract surface, the module ecosystem works. If it cannot, the extension model needs rethinking — and better to learn that now than after building media formats on top of it.

### Acceptance baseline

Before the foundation is considered ready for SDK extraction:

- `go test ./...` passes
- adapter contract tests pass against real PostgreSQL
- migration tests run from an empty database
- import boundary checks pass
- GraphQL resolver tests prove service routing
- Supervisor health probes pass against a running process

## After the thesis holds

Deliberately unplanned in detail. These follow only once the extension mechanism is proven, and each should be scoped when it starts rather than now.

- **First real module** — one media format end to end, built the way a community developer would build it. The first honest test of the SDK's ergonomics.
- **Module permissions** — what a module declares, who grants it, what enforcement means given modules compile into the binary. See the isolation tradeoff in [the overview](index.md); this is a declaration and audit mechanism, not containment.
- **Module distribution** — how the Supervisor discovers, selects and pulls a community module. Manifest shape, signing, trust tiers.
- **Export formats** — NFO for other systems, `.mos` for Mosaic-to-Mosaic portability. Generated on demand from authoritative state ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-storage-authority-and-transaction-scope.md)).
- **Job queue** — the `jobs` tables exist with no service on them. `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` is the intended pattern, for import, provider sync and enrichment.
- **`LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`** — an accelerator over the outbox worker's existing poll, not a replacement for it. Notifications are dropped when no listener is connected, so the poll stays as the floor.
- **Shell and SDUI** — the server-driven interface.
- **Mosaic Design Language** — acrylic with weight, artwork as the light source.

## Working rules

- **One slice at a time**, in order, each passing its gate before the next begins.
- **Report blockers, do not force past them.** The reference capability slice was stopped twice and reported instead of bodged. That was correct both times, and it is why the fix was a design decision rather than a workaround buried in code.
- **Code is authoritative where code exists.** Documentation describes what is built; it does not specify what is not.
- **When implementation contradicts a specification, the specification is wrong.** Fix it there, in the same session, rather than carrying a correction in a repository-local note.
