# MDS-001 — Design Token Architecture

> *Tokens are not values. They are the language through which the Design System communicates intent.*

---

# Purpose

The Mosaic Design Language (MDL) establishes:

- Why Mosaic exists.
- How decisions are made.
- How the platform thinks.
- How the platform behaves.
- How understanding is organised.

MDS-001 begins the implementation layer.

It defines how those concepts become a machine-readable design system.

Unlike many design systems, MDS-001 is **not** simply a colour token document.

It defines the architectural hierarchy through which every future Mosaic client will express the same conceptual experience.

---

# Relationship to MDL

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["MDL"]
N2["Concepts"]
N3["Design Tokens"]
N4["Runtime Resolution"]
N5["Components"]
N6["Presentation"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
```

Tokens are the first implementation artefact.

Everything beneath MDS-001 depends upon them.

---

# Scope

This specification defines:

- Token philosophy
- Token hierarchy
- Token taxonomy
- Primitive and Semantic Token states
- Composition inputs
- Resolved Token model
- Token inheritance
- Token resolution
- Token lifecycle
- Versioning
- Module intent interaction
- public Semantic Tokens for Authored Layout

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- Colours
- Typography values
- Motion curves
- Components
- Materials

Those are defined by later MDS specifications.

---

# Guiding Question

MDS-001 exists to answer one question.

> **How should design decisions become implementation?**

---

# Token Statement

Within Mosaic:

> **Tokens describe intent.**

They do not describe implementation.

For example.

Poor.

```

Blue500
```

Better.

```

Brand.Primary
```

Better still.

```

Surface.Hero
```

The further implementation moves from raw values towards meaning, the easier the system becomes to evolve.

---

# Primary Token Model

The Mosaic Design System separates authored Platform tokens from generated client output.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

N1["Primitive"]
N2["Semantic"]
N3["Runtime Resolver"]
N4["Resolved Token Set"]
N5["Renderer Adapter"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
```

Composition, Module intent, Focus, accessibility, capability and budget enter the resolver as governed context rather than additional token layers.

Future chapters define every layer in detail.

---

# Expected Outcome

After reading MDS-001 contributors should understand:

- how tokens are organised
- why semantic tokens exist
- why Resolved Tokens exist
- how components consume tokens
- how Adaptive Composition and Authored Layout consume the same token system
- how Modules provide intent and consume existing Semantic Tokens without creating new tokens
- how future token systems should evolve

without discussing specific colour palettes or component implementations.
