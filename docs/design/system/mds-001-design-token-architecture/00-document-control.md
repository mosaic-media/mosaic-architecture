# Purpose

MDS-001 defines the implementation architecture of the Mosaic Design System.

It establishes how abstract concepts defined within the MDL become machine-readable design decisions.

Unlike traditional token systems that primarily describe colours and spacing, Mosaic tokens represent **design intent**.

The Design Token Architecture therefore becomes the implementation bridge between:

- philosophy
- behaviour
- composition
- presentation

---

# Authority

MDS-001 governs:

- Token hierarchy
- Token taxonomy
- Semantic naming
- Runtime resolution
- Token inheritance
- Token lifecycle
- Extension integration
- Cross-platform consistency

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- colour palettes
- typography scales
- motion values
- materials
- components

Those specifications consume the architecture established here.

---

# Relationship To MDL

The Design Token Architecture intentionally begins after every conceptual decision has already been made.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

Vision
Vision --> Principles
Principles --> MentalModel
MentalModel --> Interaction
Interaction --> Composition
Composition --> Tokens
Tokens --> Presentation
```

Tokens should never redefine concepts established by MDL.

Their responsibility is implementation.

Not philosophy.

---

# Design Intent

Most design systems expose implementation directly.

Examples include:

```
Blue500

8px

24px

Shadow3
```

These values communicate implementation.

They communicate almost nothing about meaning.

Mosaic intentionally separates:

```
Meaning

↓

Intent

↓

Implementation
```

Tokens therefore communicate:

> **Why a value exists**

rather than merely:

> **What its value is.**

---

# Reader Expectations

Before reading this specification contributors should understand:

- MDL-001 Vision
- MDL-002 Principles
- MDL-003 Mental Model
- MDL-004 Interaction Model
- MDL-005 Composition Model

MDS intentionally assumes that all conceptual work has already been completed.

Its responsibility is implementation.

---

# Architectural Scope

The Design Token Architecture governs:

- token structure
- semantic intent
- runtime adaptation
- inheritance
- resolution
- stability
- portability

It intentionally avoids:

- framework APIs
- CSS variables
- Flutter themes
- SwiftUI implementations
- Compose implementations

Those become client-specific implementation details.

---

# Stability

Expected lifetime.

| Artefact | Expected Lifetime |
|----------|-------------------|
| CSS Variables | Months |
| Flutter Theme | Months |
| SwiftUI Theme | Months |
| Token Values | Years |
| Token Hierarchy | Years |
| Token Philosophy | Decades |

The hierarchy should evolve significantly more slowly than the values it contains.

---

# Success Criteria

MDS-001 succeeds when:

- every Mosaic client expresses the same design language
- token names communicate meaning rather than implementation
- runtime adaptation becomes implementation-independent
- contributors rarely consume primitive values directly
- future specifications naturally build upon this architecture

A successful Design Token Architecture should become almost invisible.

Contributors should think in semantic intent rather than implementation values.
