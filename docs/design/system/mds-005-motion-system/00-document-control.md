# Purpose

MDS-005 defines the Motion System used throughout Mosaic.

Motion is not treated as visual decoration.

It is treated as the visible expression of behavioural change.

Where the Interaction Model explains:

> **Why the user's World changes.**

The Motion System explains:

> **How that change should become perceptible.**

Its responsibility is to transform behavioural evolution into physical continuity.

---

# Authority

MDS-005 governs:

- Motion philosophy
- Behavioural transitions
- Material motion
- Refraction movement
- Temporal continuity
- Motion hierarchy
- Runtime motion resolution
- Motion accessibility
- Platform motion

This specification intentionally does **not** govern:

- Interaction behaviour
- Business logic
- Component implementation
- Layout

Those systems initiate change.

Motion communicates it.

---

# Relationship To MDS

Motion sits after Materials and Typography because both participate in movement.

Vision
Vision --> Principles

Typography --> Motion

Components --> Presentation
```

Motion consumes:

- Behaviour
- Composition
- Materials
- Typography

It communicates:

- continuity
- hierarchy
- physical evolution

---

# Design Intent

Many motion systems begin by asking:

> Which animation should play?

Mosaic intentionally asks:

> What changed?

Motion therefore begins with behaviour rather than animation.

Animation is merely one possible implementation.

Understanding remains the architectural objective.

---

# Reader Expectations

Before reading this specification contributors should already understand:

- MDL-001 Vision
- MDL-002 Principles
- MDL-003 Mental Model
- MDL-004 Interaction Model
- MDL-005 Composition Model
- MDS-001 Design Token Architecture
- MDS-002 Colour System
- MDS-003 Material System
- MDS-004 Typography System

The Motion System assumes those concepts already exist.

Its responsibility is to make them perceptible over time.

---

# Architectural Scope

The Motion System defines:

- behavioural motion
- material response
- temporal evolution
- runtime motion
- accessibility
- platform adaptation

It intentionally avoids implementation-specific concerns such as:

- CSS animations
- Flutter animation controllers
- SwiftUI transitions
- Compose animation APIs
- easing function syntax

These are implementation artefacts.

The Motion System defines only the architectural model.

---

# Stability

Expected lifetime.

| Artefact | Expected Lifetime |
|----------|-------------------|
| Animation APIs | Months |
| Motion Curves | Years |
| Motion Hierarchy | Years |
| Behavioural Motion | Decades |
| Motion Philosophy | Decades |

Rendering technology may evolve.

Motion behaviour should remain recognisably Mosaic.

---

# Success Criteria

MDS-005 succeeds when:

- users always understand what changed
- movement preserves continuity
- materials move believably
- typography remains readable during transitions
- accessibility remains uncompromised
- motion quietly reinforces understanding rather than demanding attention

Users should rarely notice animation.

They should simply feel that the interface naturally evolved.
