# MDS-005 — Motion System

> *Motion is not animation. Motion is the visible expression of understanding changing over time.*

> **Release applicability:** Mosaic v1 uses governed component transitions and Motion Tokens. Behavioural Cost, critical damping and Composition-wide mathematical resolution are preserved for the post-v1 Adaptive Composition Runtime. Refraction Motion remains governed separately and is not deferred.

---

# Purpose

The previous Mosaic Design System specifications established:

- Design Tokens
- Colour
- Materials
- Typography

These define what the interface is.

MDS-005 defines **how that interface changes**.

Unlike conventional motion systems, which primarily focus on visual transitions, the Mosaic Motion System exists to communicate behavioural continuity.

Motion should explain:

- what changed,
- why it changed,
- how it relates to the previous state.

The user should never perceive animation.

They should perceive understanding.

# Relationship to Previous Specifications

N3["Mental Model"]
N4["Interaction"]
N5["Composition"]
N6["Tokens"]
N7["Colour"]
N8["Materials"]

N5 --> N6
N6 --> N7
N7 --> N8
N8 --> N9
N9 --> N10
N10 --> N11
N11 --> N12
```

The Motion System consumes:

- Interaction Model
- Composition
- Material System
- Typography

It communicates behavioural evolution over time.

# Scope

This specification defines:

- Motion Philosophy
- Motion Hierarchy
- Behavioural Motion
- Material Motion
- Refraction Motion
- Temporal Continuity
- Motion Curves
- Continuity-Key Matching
- Motion Accessibility
- Runtime Motion Resolution
- Platform Motion

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- Components
- Layout
- Business Logic
- Interaction Behaviour

Those systems drive motion.

Behavioural Cost, critical damping and Composition-wide mathematical resolution are preserved as deferred research in [MDP-001 — Adaptive Composition Runtime](../../../engineering/architecture/mdp-001-adaptive-composition-runtime/15-motion-model.md).

They do not define it.

---

# Guiding Question

MDS-005 exists to answer one question.

> **How should behavioural change become visible?**

Not:

> Which animation should play?

---

# Motion Statement

Within Mosaic:

> **Motion communicates understanding.**

If removing motion reduces understanding...

The motion belongs.

If removing motion changes only appearance...

The motion should be questioned.

---

# Motion Responsibilities

The Motion System separates motion into several conceptual layers.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Behaviour"]
N2["Temporal Meaning"]
N3["Material Response"]
N4["Motion"]
N5["Presentation"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
```

Each layer contributes one responsibility.

Motion is therefore the consequence of behaviour rather than an isolated visual system.

---

# Expected Outcome

After reading MDS-005 contributors should understand:

- why Mosaic moves,
- how behaviour drives motion,
- how materials participate,
- how continuity is preserved,
- how accessibility affects motion,
- how runtime motion is resolved,
- how conceptual distance and shared identity determine transition scale,

without discussing rendering technologies or animation frameworks.
