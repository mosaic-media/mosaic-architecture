# Type Scale

---

# Purpose

Editorial Hierarchy defines **what deserves emphasis**.

The Type Scale defines **how that emphasis is physically communicated**.

Unlike many design systems, the Mosaic Type Scale is **not** a mathematical ladder of font sizes.

It is a reading system.

Every step exists to support:

- understanding,
- rhythm,
- hierarchy,
- companionship.

Typography should encourage reading.

Not simply display information.

---

# Definition

Within MDS, the **Type Scale** is defined as:

> **The ordered system of typographic roles through which editorial hierarchy becomes physically readable.**

The Type Scale expresses hierarchy.

It does not create it.

Hierarchy already exists within the Composition.

---

# Philosophy

Many interfaces define typography like this.

```text
12

14

16

18

20

24

32

48
```

These are numbers.

They communicate almost nothing.

Mosaic instead thinks in reading roles.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Display"]
N2["Heading"]
N3["Section"]
N4["Body"]
N5["Supporting"]
N6["Caption"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
```

Values exist only to support those roles.

---

# Scale Before Size

Typography should always be selected by role.

Not measurement.

Incorrect.

```text
Use 24px
```

Correct.

```text
Use Heading
```

The Design System determines the correct implementation.

Applications should never depend upon physical measurements.

---

# Scale Hierarchy

The Mosaic Type Scale contains six primary levels.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Display"]
N2["Heading"]
N3["Section"]
N4["Body"]
N5["Supporting"]
N6["Caption"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
```

Each level exists because it communicates a different editorial responsibility.

---

# Display

Purpose.

Communicate major emotional moments.

Examples include:

- Hero title
- onboarding
- welcome
- major transitions

Display typography should remain rare.

Overuse weakens emphasis.

---

# Heading

Purpose.

Establish orientation.

Examples.

- film title
- book title
- artist
- collection

Headings should communicate confidence.

Not visual drama.

---

# Section

Purpose.

Organise the Composition.

Examples.

- Continue Watching
- Related Works
- Recently Added
- Chapters

Sections divide understanding into meaningful editorial groups.

---

# Body

Purpose.

Support sustained reading.

Body typography represents the majority of reading throughout Mosaic.

Examples.

- synopsis
- descriptions
- reviews
- biographies

Comfort should always have higher priority than compactness.

---

# Supporting

Purpose.

Communicate secondary understanding.

Examples.

- runtime
- release year
- author
- subtitle language
- resolution

Supporting typography should remain easy to read while remaining visually quieter than Body text.

---

# Caption

Purpose.

Communicate peripheral detail.

Examples.

- timestamps
- codec
- bitrate
- diagnostics
- technical metadata

Caption typography should never become unreadable.

Quiet does not mean small.

It means lower editorial importance.

---

# Scale Relationships

Each level should feel related to the levels around it.

Example.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Heading"]
N2["Section"]
N3["Body"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

The transition should feel gradual.

Not abrupt.

Readers should naturally move through the hierarchy without consciously noticing changes in scale.

---

# Optical Rhythm

Typography should create rhythm rather than mathematical progression.

Poor.

```text
16

18

20

22

24
```

Preferred.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Display"]
N2["Heading"]
N3["Section"]
N4["Body"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

Readers perceive rhythm.

Not pixel values.

The scale should therefore optimise perception.

Not arithmetic.

---

# Reading Distance

Different contexts require different perceived scale.

Examples.

Television.

↓

Greater viewing distance.

↓

Larger physical implementation.

Phone.

↓

Closer viewing distance.

↓

Smaller physical implementation.

The editorial role remains identical.

Only implementation changes.

---

# Hero Scale

Hero Typography should possess the greatest physical presence.

However...

It should never dominate through size alone.

Hero emphasis should emerge through:

- hierarchy
- composition
- spacing
- materials
- typography

Working together.

Typography should never carry hierarchy independently.

---

# Long-Form Reading

Books.

Reviews.

Descriptions.

Editorial content.

These experiences should optimise:

- line length
- rhythm
- paragraph spacing
- eye movement

The Body role therefore becomes one of the most carefully tuned parts of the entire Typography System.

Comfort should remain the primary objective.

---

# Runtime Adaptation

The Type Scale may adapt according to:

- accessibility
- viewing distance
- platform
- display density

It should never adapt because:

- artwork changed
- atmosphere changed

Atmosphere influences Materials.

Typography remains comparatively stable.

---

# Variable Fonts

Future implementations may use variable font technology.

The Type Scale should express:

- weight
- width
- optical size

through semantic roles.

Applications should never manipulate these values directly.

The Variable Font System is defined later within this specification.

---

# Accessibility

The Type Scale should remain recognisable regardless of:

- increased text size
- reduced vision
- high contrast
- platform scaling

Increasing text size should preserve hierarchy.

Not flatten it.

Every editorial role should remain identifiable.

---

# Good Examples

## Film

Display.

↓

Film Title.

Heading.

↓

Continue Watching.

Section.

↓

Cast.

Body.

↓

Synopsis.

Supporting.

↓

Runtime.

Caption.

↓

HDR.

Readers instinctively understand importance.

---

## Reading

Heading.

↓

Book Title.

Section.

↓

Current Chapter.

Body.

↓

Content.

Supporting.

↓

Progress.

Caption.

↓

Page Count.

Long-form reading remains comfortable.

---

## Administration

Heading.

↓

Users.

Section.

↓

Permissions.

Body.

↓

Configuration.

Caption.

↓

Diagnostics.

Editorial consistency remains intact despite higher information density.

---

# Anti-patterns

## Pixel Thinking

Selecting typography by measurement.

---

## Decorative Scale

Large text used purely because space exists.

---

## Tiny Metadata

Caption becoming unreadable.

---

## Equal Scale

Every editorial role appearing visually identical.

Hierarchy disappears.

---

# Type Scale Model

```mermaid
flowchart TD

EditorialHierarchy
EditorialHierarchy --> TypeScale
TypeScale --> ResponsiveScaling
ResponsiveScaling --> Presentation
```

Editorial intent determines the role.

The Type Scale determines the physical expression.

---

# Relationship To Future Chapters

The next chapter defines **Reading Rhythm**.

The Type Scale answers:

> **How large should each editorial role feel?**

Reading Rhythm answers:

> **How should those roles work together over time?**

Together they create typography that feels read rather than scanned.

---

# Summary

The Type Scale is not a collection of font sizes.

It is a reading hierarchy.

Every level should encourage effortless movement through the user's current World.

Users should naturally know:

- where to begin,
- what deserves attention,
- what supports understanding,

without consciously analysing typography.

That effortless progression is the defining objective of the Mosaic Type Scale.
