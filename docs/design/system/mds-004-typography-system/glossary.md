# Glossary

---

# A

## Accessibility Typography

Typography resolved according to user accessibility requirements while preserving semantic hierarchy and reading rhythm.

Accessibility may reflow Composition and relax preferred line limits.

---

# B

## Body

The semantic typography role for descriptions, biographies, reviews and sustained reading.

Body establishes the reference size for the provisional Type Scale.

---

# E

## Editorial Hierarchy

The ordered relationship between semantic typography roles derived from Composition.

Typography expresses Editorial Hierarchy but does not create conceptual importance.

## Editorial Role

A semantic typography responsibility independent from physical implementation.

Mosaic defines Hero, Title, Heading, Body, Label and Metadata.

---

# H

## Heading

The semantic typography role that organises a section or conceptual group.

## Hero

The highest semantic typography role, used with restraint to introduce the current Focus when Composition requires a visible typographic title.

## Hero Typography

The editorial expression of the current Hero while preserving the emotional dominance of entertainment artwork.

---

# L

## Label

The semantic typography role for navigation, controls, actions and compact field identification.

---

# M

## Metadata

The subordinate semantic typography role for facts such as runtime, year, rating, timestamp or technical context.

## Mona Sans

The provisional single Platform typeface used across Mosaic semantic typography roles.

Script-specific compatibility fallbacks do not become additional brand typefaces.

---

# O

## Optical Size

A variable-font axis that adapts glyph construction for rendered size.

Mosaic resolves Optical Size automatically where supported.

---

# R

## Reading Rhythm

The deliberate pacing created by type scale, line height, measure, paragraph spacing and hierarchy.

## Responsive Typography

The capability-driven client resolution of semantic typography roles into readable physical values.

Responsive Typography does not use a permanent device class.

## Runtime Typography Resolver

The client-owned subsystem that combines editorial role, viewing context, accessibility, content pressure and renderer capability into concrete typography.

---

# T

## Title

The semantic typography role that identifies the primary page, collection or object.

## Type Scale

The ordered ratio system through which semantic typography hierarchy becomes physically readable.

The current values are provisional alpha baselines.

---

# V

## Variable Font

A font resource that can continuously adapt supported axes such as weight and optical size.

Variable-font behaviour remains behind the Typography Resolver.

---

# W

## Weight

The perceived visual strength of typography.

Mosaic uses weight to reinforce hierarchy and not as decoration.

---

# Terminology Rules

Use Hero, Title, Heading, Body, Label and Metadata for current semantic typography roles.

Describe roles before values and reading conditions before client categories.
