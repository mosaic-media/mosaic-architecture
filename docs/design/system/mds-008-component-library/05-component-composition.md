# Component Composition

---

# Purpose

Individual Components rarely exist alone.

A Hero Tile may require:

- Container Component,
- Media Component,
- Text Component,
- Action Component.

Component Composition defines how these implementation primitives combine to faithfully render one resolved Tile.

Unlike the Tile Framework, Component Composition is **not** concerned with behavioural grouping.

That work has already been completed.

Its responsibility is purely implementation.

---

# Definition

Within MDS, **Component Composition** is defined as:

> **The deterministic assembly of implementation Components required to render one resolved Tile while preserving the behavioural intent established by the runtime.**

Component Composition concerns implementation.

Behaviour remains external.

---

# Philosophy

Traditional UI frameworks frequently begin by composing widgets.

Examples.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Card"]
N2["Image"]
N3["Text"]
N4["Buttons"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

Mosaic intentionally begins one layer higher.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Resolved Tile"]
N2["Component Composition"]
N3["Platform Rendering"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

The Tile determines composition.

Components implement it.

---

# Behaviour Before Composition

Components should never determine what belongs together.

Incorrect.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Media"]
N2["Text"]
N3["Looks Correct"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Correct.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Hero Tile"]
N2["Resolved Contract"]
N3["Component Composition"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Runtime understanding always precedes implementation.

---

# One Tile

Every Component Composition should implement one Tile.

Example.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Hero Tile"]
N2["Container"]
N3["Media"]
N4["Text"]
N5["Action"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
```

The Tile remains the behavioural unit.

Components remain implementation details.

---

# Composition Inputs

Component Composition consumes:

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Resolved Tile"]
N2["Material Contract"]
N3["Typography Contract"]
N4["Motion Contract"]
N5["Interaction Contract"]
N6["Accessibility Contract"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
```

Every required decision has already been made.

---

# Composition Outputs

Component Composition produces:

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Platform Component Tree"]
N2["Rendering Tree"]
N3["Accessibility Tree"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Behaviour does not appear within these outputs.

---

# Container First

Most Component Compositions begin with a Container Component.

Purpose.

Provide:

- structure,
- clipping,
- spacing,
- Material implementation.

The Container should never introduce behavioural meaning.

---

# Media Composition

Media Components render:

- artwork,
- thumbnails,
- video,
- imagery.

Media Components should never determine:

- hierarchy,
- Hero status,
- interaction.

Those responsibilities belong to the Tile.

---

# Typography Composition

Text Components render resolved Typography Contracts.

Example.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Heading"]
N2["Text Component"]

N1 --> N2
```

Typography should never be chosen by Component Composition.

The runtime already resolved it.

---

# Action Composition

Action Components render behavioural intent.

Example.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Action Tile"]
N2["Interaction Contract"]
N3["Action Component"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Buttons remain implementation details.

Interaction remains behavioural.

---

# Indicator Composition

Indicators render resolved state.

Examples.

- playback progress,
- download progress,
- activity.

Indicators should never compute state independently.

They simply display resolved values.

---

# Nested Composition

Components may contain other Components.

Example.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Container"]
N2["Media"]
N3["Text"]
N4["Action"]

N1 --> N2
N1 --> N3
N1 --> N4
```

Nested composition improves implementation.

It should never alter Tile identity.

---

# Material Cohesion

Every Component within one Tile should consume compatible Material Contracts.

Example.

Hero Tile.

↓

Hero Material.

↓

Every child Component inherits compatible Material behaviour.

Components should never introduce conflicting Materials.

---

# Typography Cohesion

Editorial hierarchy should remain intact.

Example.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Heading"]
N2["Supporting"]
N3["Caption"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Component Composition should preserve this ordering exactly.

---

# Motion Cohesion

Components should execute one Motion Profile.

Example.

Hero Tile.

↓

Hero Motion.

↓

Every child Component participates.

Movement should appear unified.

Not individually animated.

---

# Accessibility Cohesion

Accessibility Contracts should apply consistently across every Component within a Tile.

Example.

Large text.

↓

Every Text Component updates.

Reduced motion.

↓

Every child Component respects Motion Contracts.

Accessibility should remain behaviourally coherent.

---

# Adaptive Composition

Adaptive behaviour may alter Component Composition.

Example.

Desktop.

↓

Media.

↓

Text.

↓

Actions.

Phone.

↓

Media.

↓

Text.

↓

Collapsed Actions.

The behavioural Tile remains identical.

Only implementation changes.

---

# Runtime Updates

Updated Contracts should generally update existing Components.

Preferred.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["New Contract"]
N2["Existing Component Tree"]
N3["Updated Rendering"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Avoid.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Destroy Tree"]
N2["Create Tree"]

N1 --> N2
```

Stable implementation improves performance while preserving continuity.

---

# Platform Independence

Every platform should construct equivalent Component trees.

Flutter.

↓

Hero Components.

React.

↓

Equivalent Hero Components.

SwiftUI.

↓

Equivalent Hero Components.

Implementation differs.

Behaviour remains identical.

---

# Modules

Modules never define Component Composition.

Modules contribute:

- behaviour,
- Expressions.

The Tile Framework resolves presentation.

Platform implementations compose Components.

Every module therefore automatically inherits native implementation quality.

---

# Good Examples

## Hero

Resolved Hero Tile.

↓

Container.

↓

Media.

↓

Text.

↓

Action.

↓

Rendering.

Everything reflects one behavioural contract.

---

## Timeline

Timeline Tile.

↓

Container.

↓

Indicator.

↓

Text.

Behaviour remains runtime owned.

---

## Metadata

Metadata Tile.

↓

Container.

↓

Text.

↓

Indicator.

Editorial hierarchy remains intact.

---

# Anti-patterns

## Smart Composition

Component trees determining behaviour.

---

## Platform Composition

Different clients inventing different Component structures.

---

## Behavioural Containers

Containers mutating runtime state.

---

## Component Hierarchy

Implementation structure redefining behavioural hierarchy.

---

# Component Composition Model

```mermaid
flowchart TD

ResolvedTile
ResolvedTile --> ComponentContracts
ComponentContracts --> Container
Container --> Media
Container --> Text
Container --> Action
Container --> Indicator
Media --> Rendering
Text --> Rendering
Action --> Rendering
Indicator --> Rendering
```

Resolved Tiles determine composition.

Components faithfully implement it.

---

# Relationship To Future Chapters

The next chapter defines **Rendering Architecture**.

Component Composition explains:

> **How Components combine into implementation.**

Rendering Architecture explains:

> **How those Components become efficient, deterministic presentation across every supported rendering technology.**

Together they complete the implementation architecture of the Component Library.

---

# Summary

Component Composition intentionally remains simple.

It assembles Components.

It does not solve behaviour.

Every Component tree should faithfully reflect:

- one Tile,
- one behavioural intent,
- one runtime contract.

By keeping implementation downstream from behaviour, Mosaic ensures that rendering technology can evolve indefinitely without changing the architectural language of the platform.
