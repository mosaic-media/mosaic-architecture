# MDS-003 — Material System

> *Materials are not textures. They are physical behaviours through which the user's entertainment becomes part of the interface.*

---

# Purpose

The Mosaic Design Language established:

- Why Mosaic exists.
- How it thinks.
- How it behaves.
- How understanding is organised.

The Design System has established:

- Design Tokens
- Colour Architecture

MDS-003 defines how those concepts become **physical interface materials**.

Unlike traditional design systems, Mosaic does not treat materials as decorative surfaces.

Materials are considered physical participants within the user's entertainment World.

They receive:

- Runtime Atmosphere
- Refraction
- Light
- Hierarchy
- Interaction

and transform those inputs into a coherent visual experience.

The Material System consumes:

- Design Tokens
- Semantic Colours
- Runtime Atmosphere

It produces:

- Physical Surfaces
- Acrylic Behaviour
- Refraction
- Depth
- Environmental Response

---

# Scope

This specification defines:

- Material Philosophy
- Material Hierarchy
- Canvas
- Acrylic
- Hero Material
- Overlay Material
- Refraction
- UV Mapping
- Light Transport
- Material Resolution
- Runtime Material Behaviour

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- Typography
- Components
- Motion Curves
- Layout
- Interaction

Those systems consume Materials.

They do not define them.

# Guiding Question

MDS-003 exists to answer one question.

> **How should the interface physically exist?**

Not:

> How should it be coloured?

---

# Material Statement

Within Mosaic:

> **Materials communicate physical presence rather than visual decoration.**

Every material should answer:

- What is this?
- How does light interact with it?
- How does it relate to the user's entertainment?

before it answers:

- How does it look?

---

# Material Responsibilities

The Material System separates responsibilities into independent layers.

Each layer contributes one responsibility.

No layer duplicates another.

---

# Expected Outcome

After reading MDS-003 contributors should understand:

- why Mosaic uses Acrylic
- how Runtime Atmosphere interacts with materials
- how Refraction works
- how UV mapping supports adaptation
- how surfaces establish hierarchy
- how future rendering systems should implement these ideas

without discussing specific rendering technologies.
