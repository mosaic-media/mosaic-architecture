# MDS-002 — Colour System

> *Colour should communicate understanding before identity, and identity before decoration.*

---

# Purpose

[MDS-001](../mds-001-design-token-architecture/index.md) established how design intent becomes machine-readable through the Design Token Architecture.

MDS-002 defines how colour expresses that intent.

Unlike conventional colour systems, the Mosaic Colour System is not centred around a brand palette.

Instead, it balances three independent responsibilities:

- Brand Identity
- Semantic Communication
- Runtime Atmosphere

These responsibilities intentionally remain separate.

The result is a colour system that is:

- recognisable
- adaptive
- accessible
- artwork-aware
- implementation independent

# Relationship to Previous Specifications

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Vision"]
N2["Principles"]
N3["Mental Model"]
N4["Interaction"]
N5["Composition"]
N6["Design Tokens"]
N7["Colour System"]
N8["Material System"]
N9["Components"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
N6 --> N7
N7 --> N8
N8 --> N9
```

The Colour System implements the semantic architecture established by [MDS-001](../mds-001-design-token-architecture/index.md).

It never replaces it.

# Scope

This specification defines:

- Brand Colours
- Static Mosaic And Resolved Co-Brand Illumination
- Semantic Colours
- Neutral Acrylic Tint Intent
- Runtime Atmosphere
- Artwork Colour Extraction
- Adaptive Colour
- Theme Architecture
- Light Mode
- Dark Mode
- Accessibility
- Colour Resolution
- Adaptive Neutral Foregrounds
- Functional Colour Isolation

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- Materials
- Components
- Typography
- Motion
- Layout

Those specifications consume colour.

They do not define it.

# Guiding Question

MDS-002 exists to answer one question.

> **How should colour communicate meaning?**

Not:

> Which colours should we use?

---

# Colour Statement

Within Mosaic:

> **Colour communicates understanding first.**

Brand second.

Decoration last.

If colour ever becomes the primary source of understanding, accessibility has already failed.

---

# Colour Responsibilities

The Mosaic Colour System separates colour into three independent systems.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Brand"]
N2["Semantic"]
N3["Atmosphere"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Each system exists for one purpose.

They intentionally do not overlap.

---

# Expected Outcome

After reading MDS-002 contributors should understand:

- how Mosaic uses colour
- how artwork influences the interface
- how runtime atmosphere works
- how accessibility is preserved
- how themes evolve
- how clients resolve colour consistently
- how neutral Acrylic tint intent resolves without changing Material physics
- how co-brand colours become a governed Indigo-and-partner illumination pair
- how foreground and functional colours remain stable under environmental light

without discussing implementation.
