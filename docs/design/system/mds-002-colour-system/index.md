# MDS-002 — Colour System

> *Colour should communicate understanding before identity, and identity before decoration.*

---

# Purpose

MDS-001 established how design intent becomes machine-readable through the Design Token Architecture.

MDS-002 defines how colour expresses that intent.

Unlike conventional colour systems, the Mosaic Colour System is not centred around a brand palette.

Instead, it balances three independent responsibilities:

- Brand Identity
- Semantic Communication
- Runtime Atmosphere

These responsibilities intentionally remain separate.

The result is a colour system that is:

- recognisable
- adaptive
- accessible
- artwork-aware
- implementation independent

The Colour System implements the semantic architecture established by MDS-001.

It never replaces it.

# Scope

This specification defines:

- Brand Colours
- Semantic Colours
- Runtime Atmosphere
- Artwork Colour Extraction
- Adaptive Colour
- Theme Architecture
- Light Mode
- Dark Mode
- Accessibility
- Colour Resolution

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- Materials
- Components
- Typography
- Motion
- Layout

Those specifications consume colour.

They do not define it.

# Guiding Question

MDS-002 exists to answer one question.

> **How should colour communicate meaning?**

Not:

> Which colours should we use?

---

# Colour Statement

Within Mosaic:

> **Colour communicates understanding first.**

Brand second.

Decoration last.

If colour ever becomes the primary source of understanding, accessibility has already failed.

---

# Colour Responsibilities

The Mosaic Colour System separates colour into three independent systems.

```
Brand

↓

Semantic

↓

Atmosphere
```

Each system exists for one purpose.

They intentionally do not overlap.

---

# Expected Outcome

After reading MDS-002 contributors should understand:

- how Mosaic uses colour
- how artwork influences the interface
- how runtime atmosphere works
- how accessibility is preserved
- how themes evolve
- how clients resolve colour consistently

without discussing implementation.
