# Glossary

---

# Purpose

This glossary defines the compositional terminology introduced by **MDL-005 — Composition Model**.

Unlike previous glossaries, this document focuses specifically on how understanding is organised before it becomes presentation.

The terms defined here should be considered normative throughout all future Composition Engine, Tile Framework and Design System specifications.

---

# A

## Airspace Reserve

A projected region above an Expression that protects important visible content from settled cross-plane occlusion.

Other Expressions may transit through the region during motion but should not remain there when the Composition settles.

---

## Adaptive Composition

A Composition capable of reorganising itself in response to changes in:

- Focus
- Context
- Priority
- Available Space
- Device
- User Intent

while preserving understanding.

Adaptive Composition changes organisation.

It does not redefine meaning.

---

## Anchor

A stable conceptual region that preserves orientation while surrounding Compositions evolve.

Anchors communicate stability rather than attention.

Examples include:

- Navigation
- Search
- Current Focus
- Playback

---

# B

## Breathing Space

The intentional preservation of conceptual space that improves understanding.

Breathing Space exists between ideas rather than merely between interface elements.

It reinforces:

- hierarchy
- rhythm
- clarity
- adaptability

---

# C

## Composition

The intentional organisation of understanding into a coherent experience.

Composition exists before:

- layout
- components
- materials
- presentation

It communicates meaning rather than geometry.

---

## Composition Evolution

The continuous refinement of a Composition as the user's World evolves.

Composition Evolution preserves continuity while allowing understanding to change naturally.

---

## Composition Plane

A governed logical \(z\)-level with its own projected \(x,y\) occupancy.

Expressions on different Composition Planes may overlap in projection while retaining distinct hierarchy and depth relationships.

---

## Composition Solver

The conceptual process responsible for determining the optimal organisation of understanding.

The Composition Solver produces:

- Hero
- Hierarchy
- Priority
- Groupings
- Expressions

It does not produce interface.

---

# D

## Density

The amount of conceptual understanding intentionally communicated within a Composition.

Density is behavioural.

Not visual.

---

# E

## Expression

The conceptual communication pattern selected by the Composition.

Expressions remain independent from:

- components
- devices
- layouts

Examples include:

- Timeline
- Progress
- Metadata
- Notification

---

# G

## Grouping

The organisation of related Information into coherent conceptual units.

Grouping exists to reduce interpretation.

Not simply organise interface.

---

# H

## Hero

The highest-priority Expression within the current Composition.

The Hero represents:

> What deserves attention now.

A Hero is never manually assigned.

It naturally emerges from Priority.

---

## Hierarchy

The intentional ordering of attention according to the user's current World.

Hierarchy communicates Priority.

It does not create it.

---

# P

## Peripheral Information

Information currently possessing the lowest conceptual priority.

Peripheral Information remains available without competing for attention.

---

## Priority

The relative importance of Information within the user's current World.

Priority changes as:

- Focus changes
- Context changes
- Time passes
- Relationships evolve

Priority exists before Hierarchy.

---

## Progressive Disclosure

A compositional strategy in which Information becomes visible as it becomes useful.

Progressive Disclosure reduces cognitive effort while preserving access to richer understanding.

---

# R

## Responsive Presentation

A presentation strategy adapting Expressions to different devices.

Responsive Presentation should never redefine Composition.

---

# S

## Sparse Composition

A Composition intentionally communicating only essential understanding.

Sparse Compositions prioritise:

- immersion
- clarity
- continuation

---

## Spatial Puzzle

The Mosaic Composition metaphor in which persistent Expressions claim, retain and release capacity across multiple Composition Planes while preserving identity and continuity.

---

## Supporting Information

Information directly reinforcing the current Hero.

Supporting Information exists because it helps users continue their current journey.

---

# T

## Temporal Priority

Priority influenced by the passage of time.

Examples include:

- upcoming releases
- countdowns
- newly available episodes

Temporal Priority allows Compositions to evolve naturally without requiring user interaction.

---

# U

## Understanding

The successful communication of the user's current World.

Every Composition exists to maximise understanding while minimising cognitive effort.

Understanding is considered the primary success metric of the Composition Model.

# Terminology Rules

Contributors should:

- describe understanding before interface
- describe hierarchy before layout
- describe priority before visual emphasis
- describe expressions before components

Composition terminology should remain independent from implementation.
