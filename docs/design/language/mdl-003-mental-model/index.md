# MDL-003 — Mental Model

> *The interface users see is only the visible expression of the world Mosaic understands.*

---

# Purpose

MDL-001 established **why** Mosaic exists.

MDL-002 established **how** design decisions are made.

MDL-003 defines **how Mosaic thinks**.

This specification establishes the conceptual model that every contributor should internalise before designing interfaces, engineering systems or module APIs.

Unlike a UI framework, the Mental Model describes concepts rather than components.

It explains what exists inside the world of Mosaic independently of how those concepts are eventually rendered.

# Relationship to Previous Specifications

```
Vision

↓

Principles

↓

Mental Model

↓

Interaction Model

↓

Composition Model

↓

Design System

↓

Implementation
```

Everything below MDL-003 assumes the concepts defined here.

If the Mental Model changes, every downstream specification should be reviewed.

---

# Scope

This specification defines:

- Conceptual architecture
- User mental model
- Platform mental model
- Foundational concepts
- Relationships between concepts
- Information hierarchy
- World model

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- Components
- Motion
- Layout
- Tokens
- Materials
- Typography
- Rendering

Those concepts belong to later MDL and MDS specifications.

---

# Guiding Question

MDL-003 exists to answer one question.

> **How should contributors think about Mosaic?**

Not:

> How should they implement it?

---

# Mental Model Statement

Users should never think of Mosaic as:

- a media server
- a dashboard
- a streaming service
- a collection of pages

Instead they should naturally understand it as:

> **Their personal entertainment world.**

Everything within Mosaic should reinforce this understanding.

---

# Primary Concepts

The conceptual hierarchy introduced by MDL-003 is expected to become the foundation for future specifications.

```
World

↓

Focus

↓

Context

↓

Information

↓

Relationships

↓

Composition

↓

Expressions

↓

Presentation
```

Each layer answers a different question.

Future chapters define each concept individually.

---

# Expected Outcome

After reading MDL-003 a contributor should naturally understand:

- what exists within Mosaic
- how concepts relate
- what the UI is actually representing
- why composition behaves the way it does
- why modules contribute information rather than interface

without discussing implementation technologies.
