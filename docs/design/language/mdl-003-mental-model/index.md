# MDL-003 — Mental Model

> *The interface users see is only the visible expression of the world Mosaic understands.*

---

# Purpose

[MDL-001](../mdl-001-vision/index.md) established **why** Mosaic exists.

[MDL-002](../mdl-002-principles/index.md) established **how** design decisions are made.

MDL-003 defines **how Mosaic thinks**.

This specification establishes the conceptual model that every contributor should internalise before designing interfaces, engineering systems or module APIs.

Unlike a UI framework, the Mental Model describes concepts rather than components.

It explains what exists inside the world of Mosaic independently of how those concepts are eventually rendered.

# Relationship to Previous Specifications

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Vision"]
N2["Principles"]
N3["Mental Model"]
N4["Interaction Model"]
N5["Composition Model"]
N6["Design System"]
N7["Implementation"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
N6 --> N7
```

Everything below MDL-003 assumes the concepts defined here.

If the Mental Model changes, every downstream specification should be reviewed.

---

# Scope

This specification defines:

- Conceptual architecture
- User mental model
- Platform mental model
- Foundational concepts
- Relationships between concepts
- Information hierarchy
- World model

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- Components
- Motion
- Layout
- Tokens
- Materials
- Typography
- Rendering

Those concepts belong to later MDL and MDS specifications.

---

# Guiding Question

MDL-003 exists to answer one question.

> **How should contributors think about Mosaic?**

Not:

> How should they implement it?

---

# Mental Model Statement

Users should never think of Mosaic as:

- a media server
- a dashboard
- a streaming service
- a collection of pages

Instead they should naturally understand it as:

> **Their personal entertainment world.**

Everything within Mosaic should reinforce this understanding.

---

# Primary Concepts

The conceptual hierarchy introduced by MDL-003 is expected to become the foundation for future specifications.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["World"]
N2["Focus"]
N3["Context"]
N4["Information"]
N5["Relationships"]
N6["Composition"]
N7["Expressions"]
N8["Presentation"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
N6 --> N7
N7 --> N8
```

Each layer answers a different question.

Future chapters define each concept individually.

---

# Expected Outcome

After reading MDL-003 a contributor should naturally understand:

- what exists within Mosaic
- how concepts relate
- what the UI is actually representing
- why composition behaves the way it does
- why modules contribute information rather than interface

without discussing implementation technologies.
