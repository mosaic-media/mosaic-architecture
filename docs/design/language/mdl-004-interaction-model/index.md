# MDL-004 — Interaction Model

> *Understanding explains the world. Interaction explains how the world changes.*

---

# Purpose

[MDL-001](../mdl-001-vision/index.md) established **why** Mosaic exists.

[MDL-002](../mdl-002-principles/index.md) established **how** design decisions are made.

[MDL-003](../mdl-003-mental-model/index.md) established **how Mosaic understands the world**.

MDL-004 defines **how that world behaves over time**.

Where the Mental Model describes concepts, the Interaction Model describes behaviour.

It explains:

- how Focus changes
- how Context evolves
- how Composition adapts
- how movement communicates understanding
- how continuity is preserved
- how users travel through their World without leaving it

# Relationship to Previous Specifications

```mermaid

N1["Vision"]
N2["Principles"]
N3["Mental Model"]
N4["Interaction Model"]
N5["Composition Model"]
N6["Design System"]
N7["Implementation"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
N6 --> N7
```

The Interaction Model assumes the concepts introduced by the Mental Model already exist.

Its responsibility is to define how those concepts evolve during interaction.

---

# Scope

This specification defines:

- Behaviour
- Continuity
- Focus transitions
- Context transitions
- Temporal interaction
- Adaptive composition
- User flow
- Interaction hierarchy

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- Motion timing
- Animation curves
- Materials
- Components
- Typography
- Layout
- Rendering

Those concerns belong to MDS.

---

# Guiding Question

MDL-004 exists to answer one question.

> **How should Mosaic behave?**

Not:

> How should it look?

---

# Behaviour Statement

Users should never feel they have navigated between disconnected pages.

Instead they should feel that:

> **Their World has naturally reorganised itself around what now matters.**

Everything within this specification reinforces that single idea.

---

# Primary Behaviour Model

The Interaction Model introduces the following behavioural pipeline.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["World"]
N2["Focus Change"]
N3["Context Update"]
N4["Composition Re-evaluation"]
N5["Expression Selection"]
N6["Presentation Update"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
```

Interaction is therefore defined as:

> **The continuous evolution of the user's World.**

---

# Expected Outcome

After reading MDL-004, contributors should understand:

- how Mosaic changes over time
- why movement exists
- why compositions evolve
- how continuity is preserved
- how interaction differs from navigation
- why adaptive behaviour exists

without discussing implementation.
