# What Is An Interaction Model?

---

# Purpose

Before defining how Mosaic behaves, contributors must first understand what an Interaction Model is.

Many software projects unintentionally treat interaction as a collection of animations, transitions and user inputs.

Within the Mosaic Design Language, interaction is something much broader.

Interaction defines **how the user's World evolves over time**.

It is the behavioural layer that connects the conceptual architecture defined by the Mental Model with the visual implementation defined by the Design System.

---

# Definition

Within MDL, an **Interaction Model** is defined as:

> **The behavioural rules that govern how the user's World changes in response to time, intent and interaction.**

Interaction is not:

- animation
- navigation
- gestures
- buttons
- transitions

Those are implementations of interaction.

Interaction itself describes behavioural change.

---

# Why An Interaction Model Exists

A user continually asks the Platform foundation questions.

Often without consciously realising it.

Questions such as:

- Where am I?
- What changed?
- What should I look at?
- What happens next?
- Why did that move?
- Can I get back?

A good Interaction Model answers those questions naturally.

Without explanation.

Without tutorials.

Without requiring users to consciously think about software.

---

# Interaction Is Behaviour

Interaction should be understood as behaviour rather than interface.

Example.

Poor mental model.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Click Button"]
N2["Animation"]
N3["New Screen"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Mosaic mental model.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Intent"]
N2["Focus Changes"]
N3["Context Evolves"]
N4["Composition Updates"]
N5["Presentation Reflects"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
```

Notice that interface appears only at the very end.

Behaviour exists independently from interface.

---

# Interaction Begins Before Input

Interaction does not begin when the user clicks.

Interaction begins the moment the user's World changes.

Examples include:

- playback starts
- playback ends
- next episode releases
- reading progress updates
- music changes
- a module contributes new information

These events may occur:

- because of user action
- because of time
- because of external information
- because of another device

The Interaction Model governs them all consistently.

---

# Behaviour Before Motion

Movement communicates behaviour.

Movement is not behaviour itself.

For example.

Behaviour:

```

Focus changes
```

Possible implementations:

- slide
- dissolve
- expand
- reduce
- no animation

The behaviour remains identical.

Only presentation changes.

This distinction allows Mosaic to evolve visually without changing how users understand the platform.

---

# Interaction Is Continuous

Traditional applications often behave like this.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Page"]
N2["Page"]
N3["Page"]
N4["Page"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

Every action discards the previous state.

Mosaic intentionally behaves differently.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["World"]
N2["Focus"]
N3["Context"]
N4["Composition"]
N5["Updated World"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
```

Nothing is discarded.

The World simply evolves.

---

# Interaction Is Intentional

Every behavioural change should have a reason.

Users should never wonder:

- Why did that appear?
- Why did that disappear?
- Why did everything move?
- Why am I somewhere else?

Instead they should instinctively understand:

> "The platform changed because my World changed."

Understanding creates trust.

Trust reduces cognitive effort.

---

# Interaction Preserves Continuity

The primary objective of the Interaction Model is preserving continuity.

Users should feel:

- progression
- evolution
- continuity

Not:

- interruption
- relocation
- fragmentation

The interface should continuously reassure users that they remain inside the same World.

Only its current state has evolved.

---

# Interaction Has Memory

Every interaction begins with a previous state.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Previous World"]
N2["User Intent"]
N3["Updated World"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

The previous state should always influence the next.

Interaction should therefore appear cumulative rather than isolated.

This continuity allows users to build long-term confidence in how Mosaic behaves.

---

# Good Examples

## Example 01

User finishes an episode.

Instead of:

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Episode Ends"]
N2["Homepage"]

N1 --> N2
```

Mosaic behaves:

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Episode Ends"]
N2["Progress Updates"]
N3["Next Episode Gains Priority"]
N4["Composition Evolves"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

The user never leaves their current World.

---

## Example 02

User changes from Anime to Books.

The interface should communicate:

> Your attention has changed.

Not:

> You launched another application.

The World remains.

Only Focus changes.

---

# Anti-patterns

The following behaviours violate the Interaction Model.

## Teleportation

Content instantly appears elsewhere.

Continuity is lost.

---

## Page Thinking

Every interaction replaces one complete interface with another.

The World disappears.

---

## Animation Without Meaning

Movement exists purely for visual effect.

No additional understanding is created.

---

## Context Reset

Changing one small piece of information causes the entire experience to restart.

The user loses orientation.

---

# Interaction Hierarchy

Interaction always follows the same conceptual sequence.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

Intent
Intent --> Focus
Focus --> Context
Context --> Composition
Composition --> Expression
Expression --> Presentation
```

Interaction never bypasses intermediate layers.

This consistency allows users to gradually build an accurate understanding of the platform.

---

# Relationship To Future Specifications

This chapter establishes the behavioural philosophy.

Future chapters define:

- continuity
- focus transitions
- context transitions
- temporal behaviour
- interaction states
- composition evolution

Together these chapters form the complete behavioural architecture of Mosaic.

---

# Summary

The Interaction Model defines how the user's World changes.

It is not concerned with:

- visuals
- animation
- components

Instead it defines:

- behaviour
- continuity
- evolution
- understanding

The interface communicates those behaviours.

It does not invent them.
