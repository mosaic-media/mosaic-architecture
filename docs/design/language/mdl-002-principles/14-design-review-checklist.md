# Design Review Checklist

---

# Purpose

The Mosaic Design Language is intended to reduce subjective design discussions.

This checklist provides a repeatable review process that evaluates proposals against MDL rather than individual preference.

Every significant proposal should complete this checklist before implementation begins.

The objective is not to block change.

The objective is to ensure that change strengthens Mosaic rather than gradually fragmenting it.

Structured review checklists improve consistency, reduce omissions and help teams evaluate work against agreed standards rather than personal taste.  [WPDean](https://wpdean.com/design-system-documentation/)

# When To Use This Checklist

This checklist should be completed for:

- New features
- New interaction patterns
- New components
- New navigation models
- New module capabilities
- Material System changes
- Motion changes
- Composition changes
- Major refactors

Editorial documentation changes do not normally require a full review.

---

# Review Outcome

Every review should produce one of the following outcomes.

| Outcome | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Accepted | Ready for implementation |
| Accepted with Revisions | Minor changes required |
| Deferred | Requires additional research or prototyping |
| Rejected | Conflicts with MDL |
| Superseded | Replaced by another proposal |

Every rejected proposal should reference the relevant MDL principle or ADR.

# Automatic Rejection Criteria

The proposal should normally be rejected if it:

- introduces unnecessary friction
- weakens immersion
- duplicates an existing system
- competes with entertainment for attention
- introduces new terminology without justification
- exposes implementation details
- optimises engagement over understanding
- requires explanation before becoming understandable

---

# Principle Traceability

Every proposal should explicitly reference:

```
Relevant Principles

Relevant ADRs

Affected Specifications

Migration Impact

Future Work
```

Traceability ensures future contributors understand not only what changed, but why it changed.

---

# Final Question

Before approval, every reviewer should answer the following question.

> **If every future feature behaved like this proposal, would Mosaic become a better entertainment companion?**

If the answer is uncertain, further iteration is recommended before implementation.
