# Design

Design documentation defines how Mosaic thinks, behaves, presents itself, and composes product experiences.

## At a Glance

| Area | Question answered | Use it for |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| [Design Language](language/index.md) | Why should Mosaic feel and behave this way? | Vision, principles, mental models, interaction and composition intent |
| [Design System](system/index.md) | How does that intent become a reusable interface system? | Tokens, colour, materials, typography, motion, composition, Tiles and components |

The Design Language establishes intent. The Design System realises that intent as reusable design infrastructure.

## Recommended Reading Paths

- For product and design intent, begin with [MDL-001 — Mosaic Design Language Vision](language/mdl-001-vision/index.md), then follow the Design Language in order.
- For Mosaic v1 interface implementation, understand [MDL-003 — Mental Model](language/mdl-003-mental-model/index.md), then use [MDS-008 — Component Library](system/mds-008-component-library/index.md) with the supporting Token, Material, Typography and Motion specifications.
- For reusable v1 UI infrastructure, begin with [MDS-001 — Design Token Architecture](system/mds-001-design-token-architecture/index.md) and continue through [MDS-005 — Motion System](system/mds-005-motion-system/index.md) before implementing [MDS-008 — Component Library](system/mds-008-component-library/index.md).
- For post-v1 Adaptive Composition research, use [MDP-001 — Adaptive Composition Runtime](../engineering/architecture/mdp-001-adaptive-composition-runtime/index.md). It preserves the deferred mathematical solver and adaptive Tile model without making them v1 Design System requirements.

These summaries provide orientation. The linked MDL and MDS specifications remain authoritative.
