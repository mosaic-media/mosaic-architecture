# Architecture

Architecture documentation contains accepted Mosaic platform structure and clearly separated proposals for architecture that is not yet authoritative.

MAC documents are authoritative Architecture Canon. MAD documents record accepted architecture decisions and their reasoning. MDP documents preserve proposals and must be read according to their recorded Disposition.

## Architecture Canon in Brief

| Specification | In one sentence |
|---------------|-----------------|
| [MAC-001 — Platform Architecture](mac-001-platform-architecture/index.md) | Defines the accepted Platform structure, its responsibilities and the boundaries between the Platform, Supervisor, capabilities and Modules. |

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Status | In one sentence |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| [MAD-001 — Transactional Store Extensibility](mad-001-transactional-store-extensibility/index.md) | Accepted | Records why the Platform transaction boundary resolves stores through a uniform port instead of a closed interface of named Core Platform stores. |

## Deferred Proposals

| Proposal | Disposition | In one sentence |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| [MDP-001 — Adaptive Composition Runtime](mdp-001-adaptive-composition-runtime/index.md) | Deferred | Preserves the post-v1 mathematical composition solver, adaptive Tile model and calibration questions without making them current architecture. |

Begin here when you need to understand what Mosaic is. Continue to [Engineering Guides](../guides/index.md) for implementation practice, [Protocols](../protocols/index.md) for interoperability contracts and [Operations](../operations/index.md) for operational expectations.

The Architecture Canon is authoritative. Deferred proposals are non-authoritative and unscheduled until a later decision changes their Disposition. This catalogue provides orientation only.
