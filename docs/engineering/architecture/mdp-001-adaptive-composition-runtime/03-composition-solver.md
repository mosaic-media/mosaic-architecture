# Composition Solver

> **Proposal status:** Deferred and non-authoritative. This chapter preserves post-v1 research; it is not a Mosaic v1 requirement.

---

# Purpose

The Runtime World represents everything the user currently knows and experiences.

The Composition Solver transforms that World into understanding.

It is the decision-making centre of the Composition Engine.

Unlike traditional layout engines, the Composition Solver does not determine:

- grids,
- rows,
- columns,
- widgets.

Instead it determines:

- importance,
- relationships,
- hierarchy,
- expressions,
- behavioural presentation.

Every runtime experience produced by Mosaic begins here.

> **Release applicability:** This solver and its mathematical contracts are reserved for the post-v1 Adaptive Composition Runtime. Mosaic v1 renders SDUI through the client-side component library defined by [MDS-008 — Component Library](../../../design/system/mds-008-component-library/index.md).

---

# Definition

Within MDS, the **Composition Solver** is defined as:

> **The deterministic runtime system responsible for transforming the Runtime World into the optimal Composition for the user's current behavioural context.**

The Solver produces understanding.

Presentation is derived afterwards.

---

# Why A Solver Exists

Traditional applications generally solve interfaces.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Data"]
N2["Templates"]
N3["Layout"]
N4["Render"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

Mosaic intentionally solves understanding.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Runtime World"]
N2["Composition Solver"]
N3["Expressions"]
N4["Presentation"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

The Solver therefore replaces manually authored interface structure with behavioural reasoning.

---

# The Solver Never Designs

The Composition Solver should never make aesthetic decisions.

It does not determine:

- colour,
- typography,
- materials,
- spacing.

Those systems already exist.

The Solver determines:

> **What deserves attention?**

Everything else follows naturally.

---

# Inputs

The Solver consumes one Runtime World snapshot.

Conceptually.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Runtime World"]
N2["Focus"]
N3["Context"]
N4["Behaviour"]
N5["Relationships"]
N6["Information"]
N7["Capabilities"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
N6 --> N7
```

These become the complete behavioural inputs for solving.

No rendering information is required.

---

# Outputs

The Solver produces a solved Composition.

Outputs include:

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Hero"]
N2["Hierarchy"]
N3["Expressions"]
N4["Priority"]
N5["Grouping"]
N6["Behavioural Intent"]
N7["Presentation Model"]
N8["Depth And Visibility Intent"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
N6 --> N7
N7 --> N8
```

Every downstream runtime system consumes these outputs.

Depth And Visibility Intent describes semantic plane relationships, protected subjects and permitted cross-plane overlap.

It does not contain final coordinates or renderer-specific stacking values.

---

# Deterministic Solving

The Composition Solver must always remain deterministic.

Given identical:

- Runtime World,
- Behaviour,
- Context,
- Relationships,

the Solver should produce identical Composition.

This enables:

- predictable behaviour,
- runtime caching,
- replay,
- testing,
- cross-platform consistency.

---

# Behaviour Is Authority

Behaviour always possesses highest authority.

Examples.

Playback begins.

↓

Playback becomes primary.

Hero changes.

↓

Composition reorganises.

Search opens.

↓

Overlay Composition appears.

Behaviour determines composition.

The Solver simply communicates it.

---

# Focus Resolution

Only one Focus should normally exist.

Example.

```

Watching Frieren
```

The Solver identifies:

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Hero"]
N2["Frieren"]
N3["Episode 18"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Everything else becomes supporting information.

Focus should emerge naturally from the Runtime World.

---

# Relationship Resolution

Relationships significantly influence Composition.

Example.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Episode"]
N2["Season"]
N3["Series"]
N4["Manga"]
N5["Author"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
```

The Solver evaluates:

- proximity,
- behavioural relevance,
- contextual usefulness.

Relationships strengthen understanding.

Not complexity.

---

# Priority Resolution

Priority should emerge from behaviour.

Conceptually.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Behaviour"]
N2["Priority"]
N3["Hierarchy"]
N4["Expressions"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

Priority should never be inferred from:

- popularity,
- layout,
- implementation.

Understanding always possesses higher authority.

---

# Expression Resolution

The Solver never produces components.

Instead it produces Expressions.

Example.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Continue Watching"]
N2["Timeline"]
N3["Relationships"]
N4["Metadata"]
N5["Actions"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
```

Later specifications determine how these Expressions become Tiles and Components.

The Solver remains presentation independent.

---

# Group Resolution

Related information should naturally group together.

Example.

```

Current Episode

Progress

Next Episode
```

Rather than:

```

Current Episode

Codec

Progress

Reviews

Next Episode
```

Grouping reduces cognitive effort.

It should emerge from relationships rather than manual interface design.

---

# Adaptive Solving

The Solver should continuously adapt.

Behaviour changes.

↓

Composition evolves.

↓

Expressions evolve.

↓

Presentation evolves.

The engine should never require predefined layouts for every possible situation.

---

# Local Solving

Small behavioural changes should produce small compositional changes.

Example.

Playback progress updates.

↓

Timeline updates.

The Hero remains unchanged.

The Composition should avoid unnecessary recomputation whenever practical.

---

# Runtime Graph

Future implementations may represent the Runtime World internally as a graph.

Conceptually.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Runtime Graph"]
N2["Solver"]
N3["Composition"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

The graph remains an implementation detail.

The conceptual architecture defined here should remain unchanged regardless of runtime representation.

---

# Composition Profiles

Future runtime implementations may internally construct Composition Profiles.

Conceptually.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Runtime World"]
N2["Solver"]
N3["Composition Profile"]
N4["Expressions"]
N5["Presentation"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
```

Profiles improve:

- caching,
- determinism,
- incremental updates.

Applications should remain unaware of their existence.

---

# Bounded Candidate Generation

The adaptive solver should not search arbitrary pixel coordinates.

Each affected Composition Plane should generate a bounded deterministic candidate set from:

- viewport and Composition boundaries
- neighbouring Tile edges and governed clearances
- released plane-local capacity
- Tile minimum and preferred extents
- alignment relationships
- Airspace Reserve boundaries
- projected text-protection regions

The solver expands local puzzle moves from the changed Tile and retains only the best governed number of partial solutions at each search depth.

If \(S_k\) is the partial-state set at search depth \(k\), a bounded beam retains:

\[
S_{k+1}
=
\operatorname{best}_{B}
\left(
\bigcup_{s\in S_k}
\operatorname{expand}(s)
\right)
\]

where \(B\) is a private budget-derived beam width.

Candidate count, search depth and beam width must degrade before the solver threatens an interaction or Presentation deadline.

---

# Evidence-Led Implementation Sequence

The dynamic Composition architecture remains normative for the post-v1 Adaptive Composition Runtime, but its search-based implementation should follow evidence gathered from visible Mosaic v1 interfaces.

## Stage One: Mosaic v1 Component Library

Mosaic v1 should build representative interfaces through governed HTML, CSS and TypeScript components using the real Tokens, Typography, Materials, Refraction, scrolling, focus behaviour and accessibility contracts.

The initial reference set should cover:

- portrait and landscape media detail
- browsing with horizontal collections
- Continue Watching
- release schedules
- documentation
- administration dashboards
- settings and forms

These production v1 interfaces provide visual targets, performance fixtures and regression references without requiring a Composition Solver.

## Stage Two: Post-v1 Reference Profiles

Adaptive Composition research may map semantic intent into private curated Composition Profiles and resolved slots:

```mermaid
flowchart LR

N1["Semantic Intent"]
N2["Private Composition Profile"]
N3["Resolved Slots"]
N4["Presentation"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

SDUI and Modules must not address profile identifiers, slots or coordinates. Profiles are replaceable client implementation data rather than a public layout language.

## Stage Three: Calibrated Dynamic Solver

The bounded solver should generate alternative layouts and compare them with stakeholder-ranked reference compositions.

For feature vector \(\mathbf{f}\) and private weight vector \(\mathbf{w}\):

\[
C_{\mathrm{layout}} = \mathbf{w}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{f}
\]

Pairwise judgements establish that one candidate should score below another:

\[
L_a \succ L_b
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
C_{\mathrm{layout}}(L_a) < C_{\mathrm{layout}}(L_b)
\]

Fitted values provide starting calibration only. Runtime measurement, accessibility validation and design review remain authoritative.

Curated profiles should remain available as golden tests, performance benchmarks and safe fallback compositions after the dynamic solver is introduced.

---

# Solver Pipeline

Conceptually.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Runtime World"]
N2["Behaviour"]
N3["Priority"]
N4["Relationships"]
N5["Grouping"]
N6["Expressions"]
N7["Presentation Model"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
N6 --> N7
```

Every stage contributes exactly one responsibility.

---

# Runtime Updates

Typical Solver triggers include:

- Focus changes
- Behaviour changes
- Context changes
- Relationship updates
- Module contributions
- User interaction

Minor visual changes should not invoke complete recomposition.

The Solver should favour incremental behavioural evolution.

---

# Modules

Modules contribute:

- information,
- relationships,
- behaviours.

Modules never contribute:

- hierarchy,
- expressions,
- layouts,
- presentation.

The Composition Solver remains the sole authority for organising understanding.

---

# Good Examples

## Playback

Behaviour.

↓

Episode playing.

↓

Timeline promoted.

↓

Progress updated.

↓

Presentation evolves.

The user immediately understands current activity.

---

## Reading

Current Chapter.

↓

Bookmarks.

↓

Reading Progress.

↓

Supporting Information.

Everything naturally supports the reader.

---

## Music

Album.

↓

Current Track.

↓

Playback Queue.

↓

Related Albums.

The Composition reflects listening behaviour rather than library structure.

---

# Anti-patterns

## Screen Solver

Producing pages instead of understanding.

---

## Widget Solver

Selecting components before Expressions.

---

## Layout Solver

Beginning with grids rather than hierarchy.

---

## Module Composition

Allowing modules to determine presentation.

---

# Composition Solver Model

```mermaid
flowchart TD

RuntimeWorld
RuntimeWorld --> Behaviour
Behaviour --> Priority
Priority --> Relationships
Relationships --> Grouping
Grouping --> Expressions
Expressions --> PresentationModel
```

The Composition Solver transforms behavioural reality into understandable experience.

Everything else becomes implementation.

---

# Relationship To Future Chapters

The next chapter defines **Expression Resolution**.

The Composition Solver explains:

> **What should exist.**

Expression Resolution explains:

> **How those solved concepts become reusable runtime expressions.**

Together they form the conceptual centre of the Composition Engine.

---

# Summary

The Composition Solver is the runtime intelligence of Mosaic.

It continuously transforms:

- behaviour,
- information,
- relationships,
- context,

into one coherent understanding of the user's current World.

The interface is therefore never manually designed.

It is continuously solved.

That distinction is the defining architectural characteristic of the Mosaic Composition Engine.
