# Runtime Pipelines

> **Proposal status:** Deferred and non-authoritative. This chapter preserves post-v1 research; it is not a Mosaic v1 requirement.

---

# Purpose

Behaviour Orchestration defines how runtime systems evolve together.

Runtime Pipelines define **how those behavioural stages execute efficiently inside the Composition Engine**.

The Composition Engine should not be viewed as one large process.

Instead it is a series of deterministic runtime pipelines.

Each pipeline performs one responsibility.

Together they continuously construct the user's World.

---

# Definition

Within MDS, **Runtime Pipelines** are defined as:

> **The ordered execution stages through which behavioural changes are transformed into a fully resolved Presentation Model.**

Pipelines execute architecture.

They do not define architecture.

---

# Philosophy

Many runtime frameworks follow this model.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["State"]
N2["Render"]
N3["Done"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Mosaic intentionally follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Behaviour"]
N2["Pipeline"]
N3["Understanding"]
N4["Presentation"]
N5["Render"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
```

The runtime solves understanding before rendering begins.

---

# Pipeline Principles

Every runtime pipeline should satisfy the following principles.

- deterministic
- incremental
- behaviour-driven
- presentation independent
- cacheable
- observable

Pipelines should communicate intent.

Not implementation.

---

# Pipeline Overview

Every behavioural event should travel through the same conceptual pipeline.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Behaviour"]
N2["Runtime World"]
N3["Composition Solver"]
N4["Expression Resolution"]
N5["Hierarchy Resolution"]
N6["Adaptive Layout"]
N7["Presentation Model"]
N8["Rendering"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
N6 --> N7
N7 --> N8
```

No stage should be skipped.

No stage should duplicate another.

---

# Stage One

## Behaviour Intake

Purpose.

Receive behavioural events.

Examples.

- Playback Started
- Focus Changed
- Search Opened
- Chapter Completed

This stage validates behavioural intent.

It performs no presentation work.

---

# Stage Two

## Runtime World Update

Purpose.

Apply behavioural mutations to the Runtime World.

Outputs include:

- updated Focus
- updated Context
- updated Relationships

The Runtime World becomes the single source of truth for the remainder of the pipeline.

---

# Stage Three

## Composition Solver

Purpose.

Determine:

- Hero
- Priority
- Grouping
- Expressions

The Solver constructs understanding.

It produces no presentation.

---

# Stage Four

## Expression Resolution

Purpose.

Transform solved concepts into reusable Expressions.

Outputs include:

- Expression Tree
- Material Intent
- Typography Intent
- Motion Intent

Expressions remain implementation independent.

---

# Stage Five

## Runtime Hierarchy

Purpose.

Resolve behavioural importance.

Outputs include:

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Hero"]
N2["Primary"]
N3["Supporting"]
N4["Peripheral"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

Every Expression receives exactly one current runtime role.

---

# Stage Six

## Adaptive Layout

Purpose.

Project Expressions into spatial organisation.

Adaptive Layout considers:

- available extent and orientation
- viewing distance and input context
- typography and accessibility
- renderer capability and runtime budget

Behaviour remains unchanged.

Only spatial expression adapts.

---

# Stage Seven

## Presentation Model

Purpose.

Construct a platform-independent presentation description.

The Presentation Model contains:

- Expressions
- Regions
- Materials
- Typography
- Motion
- Interaction metadata

Components do not yet exist.

---

# Stage Eight

## Rendering

Rendering frameworks consume the Presentation Model.

Examples.

- Flutter
- Web
- SwiftUI
- Compose

Rendering should remain a passive implementation stage.

Behaviour has already been solved.

---

# Incremental Pipelines

Not every behavioural event should execute every stage.

Example.

Playback progress.

Preferred.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Behaviour"]
N2["Timeline Expression"]
N3["Presentation Update"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Avoid.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Behaviour"]
N2["Entire Pipeline"]
N3["Complete Rebuild"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Incremental execution improves performance while preserving behavioural correctness.

---

# Parallel Execution

Future implementations may execute independent stages concurrently.

Examples.

Typography.

↓

Parallel.

Materials.

↓

Parallel.

Motion.

↓

Parallel.

Provided they consume the same immutable Presentation Model.

Parallel execution should never compromise determinism.

---

# Pipeline Snapshots

Every stage should consume immutable inputs.

Conceptually.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Snapshot"]
N2["Stage"]
N3["Snapshot"]
N4["Next Stage"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

Immutable snapshots improve:

- replay
- testing
- debugging
- caching

No stage should mutate data owned by another stage.

---

# Failure Recovery

Pipelines should degrade gracefully.

Preferred.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Material Failure"]
N2["Fallback Material"]
N3["Continue"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Avoid.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Material Failure"]
N2["Entire Runtime Stops"]

N1 --> N2
```

The user's World should remain available whenever practical.

---

# Pipeline Caching

Pipeline stages should cache deterministic outputs.

Examples.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Runtime World"]
N2["Composition"]
N3["Cache"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Expression Tree"]
N2["Presentation Model"]
N3["Cache"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Only affected stages should recompute after behavioural changes.

---

# Observability

Future runtime implementations should expose pipeline telemetry.

Examples include:

- execution time
- cache utilisation
- invalidation reasons
- behavioural triggers
- presentation updates

Observability exists to improve runtime quality.

Not to influence behavioural architecture.

---

# Multi-Device Execution

Every device executes the same conceptual pipeline.

Desktop.

↓

Pipeline.

Phone.

↓

Pipeline.

Television.

↓

Pipeline.

Only Presentation differs.

Behavioural execution remains identical.

---

# Modules

Modules contribute:

- behaviour
- information
- relationships

Modules never participate directly in pipeline execution.

The Composition Engine determines:

- execution order
- stage boundaries
- presentation

Every module therefore inherits identical runtime behaviour.

---

# Good Examples

## Playback

Behaviour.

↓

Runtime World.

↓

Timeline updates.

↓

Presentation updates.

↓

Rendering.

Only affected stages execute.

---

## Reading

Chapter changes.

↓

Composition updates.

↓

Typography updates.

↓

Presentation.

Reading continues naturally.

---

## Search

Search opens.

↓

Overlay Expressions.

↓

Adaptive Layout.

↓

Presentation.

The underlying World remains intact.

---

# Anti-patterns

## Full Pipeline

Executing every stage for every behavioural update.

---

## Mutable Stages

Pipeline stages modifying upstream data.

---

## Rendering Pipeline

Rendering engine influencing behavioural execution.

---

## Platform Pipelines

Different clients inventing different runtime architectures.

---

# Runtime Pipeline Model

```mermaid
flowchart TD

Behaviour
Behaviour --> RuntimeWorld
RuntimeWorld --> CompositionSolver
CompositionSolver --> ExpressionResolution
ExpressionResolution --> RuntimeHierarchy
RuntimeHierarchy --> AdaptiveLayout
AdaptiveLayout --> PresentationModel
PresentationModel --> Rendering
```

Every behavioural event travels through one deterministic architectural pipeline.

---

# Relationship To Future Chapters

The next chapter defines **Composition Caching**.

Runtime Pipelines explain:

> **How runtime stages execute.**

Composition Caching explains:

> **How the results of those stages are reused efficiently while preserving deterministic behaviour.**

Together they define the execution model of the Composition Engine.

---

# Summary

Runtime Pipelines transform behavioural events into presentation through one deterministic execution architecture.

Each stage performs one responsibility.

No stage duplicates another.

The runtime therefore remains:

- predictable,
- incremental,
- cacheable,
- platform independent.

Users should never perceive these pipelines.

They should simply experience a World that continually understands and responds to them.
