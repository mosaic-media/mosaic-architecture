# Tile Lifecycle

> **Proposal status:** Deferred and non-authoritative. This chapter preserves post-v1 research; it is not a Mosaic v1 requirement.

---

# Purpose

Expressions continuously evolve as the Runtime World changes.

Tiles must evolve with them.

Unlike conventional UI components, which are frequently created and destroyed in response to interface events, Mosaic Tiles are intended to preserve behavioural continuity.

The Tile Lifecycle defines how Tiles:

- appear,
- evolve,
- persist,
- disappear,

while maintaining one continuous user experience.

The objective is not efficient rendering.

It is uninterrupted understanding.

---

# Definition

Within MDS, **Tile Lifecycle** is defined as:

> **The behavioural evolution of a Tile from creation through adaptation to retirement while preserving continuity with the Runtime World.**

The lifecycle belongs to behaviour.

Not rendering.

---

# Philosophy

Traditional UI frameworks often behave like this.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Create Widget"]
N2["Render"]
N3["Destroy Widget"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Mosaic intentionally behaves differently.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Expression"]
N2["Tile Appears"]
N3["Tile Evolves"]
N4["Tile Adapts"]
N5["Tile Retires"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
```

Users should experience continuous objects rather than disposable interface elements.

---

# Lifecycle Stages

Every Tile progresses through the same conceptual lifecycle.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Resolved"]
N2["Materialised"]
N3["Active"]
N4["Evolving"]
N5["Retiring"]
N6["Released"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
```

Each stage communicates one behavioural responsibility.

---

# Stage One

## Resolved

The Tile has been selected by Expression Mapping.

At this stage it possesses:

- identity,
- Material intent,
- Typography intent,
- Motion intent,
- Interaction intent.

It does not yet exist visually.

---

# Stage Two

## Materialised

The Tile becomes part of the Presentation Model.

Materialised Tiles now possess:

- runtime identity,
- spatial intent,
- hierarchy,
- behavioural role.

Rendering has still not occurred.

---

# Stage Three

## Active

The Tile is now visible.

Examples.

Hero Tile.

↓

Displayed.

Timeline Tile.

↓

Displayed.

Metadata Tile.

↓

Displayed.

The Tile participates fully in:

- Motion,
- Materials,
- Interaction,
- Runtime Hierarchy.

---

# Stage Four

## Evolving

Most Tiles spend the majority of their lifetime evolving.

Examples.

Playback progresses.

↓

Timeline evolves.

Hero changes.

↓

Hero Tile evolves.

Reading progresses.

↓

Progress Tile evolves.

Evolution should preserve Tile identity whenever practical.

Users should perceive continuity.

Not replacement.

---

# Stage Five

## Retiring

A Tile retires when its behavioural purpose ends.

Examples.

Search closes.

↓

Search Tile retires.

Overlay dismissed.

↓

Overlay Tile retires.

The Tile should depart naturally.

It should not simply disappear.

Retirement should preserve behavioural understanding.

---

# Stage Six

## Released

The Tile is no longer behaviourally relevant.

Runtime resources may now be reclaimed.

Importantly...

Users should already understand why the Tile disappeared before this stage occurs.

Release is an implementation concern.

Retirement is a behavioural concern.

---

# Behaviour Owns Lifecycle

Only behaviour changes Tile lifecycle.

Incorrect.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Scroll"]
N2["Destroy Tile"]

N1 --> N2
```

Correct.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Behaviour Changes"]
N2["Tile Retires"]

N1 --> N2
```

Rendering optimisations should never redefine behavioural lifetime.

---

# Identity Preservation

Whenever practical...

A Tile should evolve rather than be replaced.

Preferred.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Episode 17"]
N2["Episode 18"]
N3["Hero Tile Evolves"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Avoid.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Hero Tile Destroyed"]
N2["New Hero Tile Created"]

N1 --> N2
```

Identity continuity significantly reduces cognitive effort.

---

# Runtime Hierarchy

Hierarchy changes may alter a Tile's role.

Example.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Content Tile"]
N2["Hero Tile"]

N1 --> N2
```

The Tile remains behaviourally related.

Only its runtime importance evolves.

This distinction strengthens continuity throughout the interface.

---

# Material Continuity

Tiles should preserve Material identity throughout evolution.

Hero Tile.

↓

Hero Material.

↓

Still Hero Material.

A Tile should never unexpectedly become an unrelated material because implementation changed.

---

# Typography Continuity

Editorial roles should remain stable.

Examples.

Heading.

↓

Heading.

Supporting.

↓

Supporting.

The wording may change.

The editorial language should remain recognisable.

---

# Motion Continuity

Tile lifecycle transitions should follow the Motion System.

Examples.

Resolved.

↓

Materialised.

↓

Active.

↓

Evolving.

↓

Retiring.

↓

Released.

Movement communicates behavioural evolution.

It should never obscure it.

---

# Incremental Evolution

Small behavioural updates should produce small lifecycle changes.

Example.

Playback progresses.

↓

Timeline Tile evolves.

Everything else remains active.

Incremental evolution preserves runtime stability while reducing unnecessary work.

---

# Reuse

Future implementations may reuse Tile instances.

Conceptually.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Released Tile"]
N2["Compatible Expression"]
N3["Reuse"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
```

Reuse is an implementation optimisation.

The behavioural lifecycle remains unchanged.

---

# Runtime Ownership

The Tile Framework owns lifecycle.

Components merely render current lifecycle state.

Rendering frameworks should never independently determine:

- creation,
- retirement,
- evolution.

Behaviour remains authoritative.

---

# Modules

Modules contribute:

- Expressions,
- behaviour,
- information.

Modules never manage Tile lifecycles.

Every module therefore inherits one consistent behavioural model automatically.

---

# Good Examples

## Playback

Timeline Tile.

↓

Progress updates.

↓

Tile evolves.

↓

Playback continues.

No unnecessary replacement occurs.

---

## Reading

Bookmark added.

↓

Relationship Tile evolves.

↓

Reader continues uninterrupted.

---

## Search

Search Tile appears.

↓

Interaction.

↓

Search Tile retires.

↓

Previous Composition continues naturally.

---

# Anti-patterns

## Widget Lifecycle

Component creation determining behavioural lifetime.

---

## Instant Replacement

Destroying Tiles rather than evolving them.

---

## Platform Lifecycle

Different clients managing behavioural lifetime differently.

---

## Module Lifecycle

Modules owning Tile creation and destruction.

---

# Tile Lifecycle Model

```mermaid
flowchart TD

Expression
Expression --> Resolved
Resolved --> Materialised
Materialised --> Active
Active --> Evolving
Evolving --> Retiring
Retiring --> Released
```

Tiles evolve because behaviour evolves.

Rendering simply follows.

---

# Relationship To Future Chapters

The next chapter defines **Adaptive Tiles**.

Tile Lifecycle explains:

> **How Tiles evolve over time.**

Adaptive Tiles explain:

> **How the same Tile adapts across different environments while preserving its behavioural identity.**

Together they ensure Tiles remain both continuous and adaptive.

---

# Summary

The Tile Lifecycle ensures presentation behaves like the rest of Mosaic.

Continuous.

Behavioural.

Predictable.

Tiles should not feel disposable.

They should feel like persistent participants within the user's World, evolving naturally as behaviour changes and quietly departing only when their purpose has truly ended.
