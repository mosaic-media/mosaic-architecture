# Tile Philosophy

> **Proposal status:** Deferred and non-authoritative. This chapter preserves post-v1 research; it is not a Mosaic v1 requirement.

---

# Purpose

Before defining Tile taxonomy, lifecycle or runtime behaviour, contributors must first understand what a Tile represents within Mosaic.

Most interface frameworks begin with reusable components.

Examples include:

- cards,
- lists,
- buttons,
- tables.

These are implementation concepts.

Mosaic intentionally begins one layer higher.

A Tile is **not** an implementation.

It is a behavioural presentation primitive.

It exists to communicate one solved Expression from the Composition Engine.

---

# Philosophy Statement

> **A Tile is the physical expression of one behavioural Expression within the user's current World.**

Everything within the Tile Framework derives from this statement.

---

# Why Tiles Exist

The Composition Engine produces:

- Hero
- Timeline
- Relationships
- Metadata
- Actions
- Progress

These are Expressions.

Rendering frameworks cannot directly render Expressions.

Likewise...

Components should never understand runtime behaviour.

Tiles exist between those worlds.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Expression"]
N2["Tile"]
N3["Component"]
N4["Rendering"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

This separation preserves one of the strongest architectural boundaries within Mosaic.

---

# Tiles Are Behavioural

A Tile communicates behaviour.

Not implementation.

Example.

Incorrect.

```text
PosterCard
```

Correct.

```text
Hero Tile
```

The Hero Tile may become:

- a card,
- a full-width panel,
- a television Hero,
- a compact phone presentation.

Its behavioural identity remains unchanged.

---

# Tiles Are Physical

Unlike Expressions, Tiles possess physical identity.

They inherit:

- Materials
- Typography
- Motion
- Interaction

A Tile therefore becomes the first runtime artefact that users can perceive.

Expressions remain conceptual.

Tiles become tangible.

---

# Tiles Are Reusable

A Timeline remains:

```

Timeline
```

regardless of:

- media type,
- device,
- platform,
- layout.

Likewise.

A Timeline Tile should remain:

```

Timeline Tile
```

Its presentation evolves.

Its identity remains stable.

---

# Tiles Are Presentation Independent

Tiles intentionally avoid:

- Flutter widgets
- React components
- SwiftUI views
- Compose composables

Those belong to implementation.

The Tile Framework should remain understandable without mentioning any rendering technology.

---

# Tiles Follow Behaviour

Tiles should never determine behaviour.

Behaviour determines Expressions.

Expressions determine Tiles.

Conceptually.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Behaviour"]
N2["Expression"]
N3["Tile"]
N4["Component"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

Responsibility always flows in one direction.

---

# Tiles Preserve Meaning

A Hero Tile should remain a Hero Tile even if:

- rendered differently,
- resized,
- repositioned,
- simplified.

Meaning survives presentation.

This principle enables adaptive interfaces without behavioural fragmentation.

---

# Tiles Are Composable

Tiles intentionally combine into larger experiences.

Example.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Hero Tile"]
N2["Timeline Tile"]
N3["Metadata Tile"]
N4["Actions Tile"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

Together they communicate:

```

Playback
```

Each Tile owns one responsibility.

The Composition Engine determines how they relate.

---

# Tiles Own Presentation

Expressions communicate:

> What exists.

Tiles communicate:

> How it should exist physically.

Examples include:

- Material intent
- Typography intent
- Interaction affordance
- Motion behaviour

Rendering frameworks simply implement these characteristics.

---

# Tiles Support Adaptation

A Tile should adapt naturally.

Desktop.

↓

Expanded Hero Tile.

Phone.

↓

Compact Hero Tile.

Voice.

↓

Spoken Hero Tile.

The behavioural meaning remains identical.

Only physical presentation changes.

---

# Tiles Respect Hierarchy

Runtime Hierarchy determines Tile importance.

Hero.

↓

Hero Tile.

Supporting.

↓

Supporting Tile.

Peripheral.

↓

Peripheral Tile.

Tiles should never promote themselves.

Hierarchy always originates from the Composition Engine.

---

# Tiles Support Continuity

Tile identity should survive behavioural evolution.

Example.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Episode 17"]
N2["Episode 18"]

N1 --> N2
```

The Hero Tile evolves.

It should not disappear and reappear as another unrelated Tile.

Continuity reduces cognitive effort.

---

# Tiles Support Materials

Every Tile inherits Material Intent.

Examples.

Hero Tile.

↓

Hero Material.

Overlay Tile.

↓

Overlay Material.

Supporting Tile.

↓

Surface Material.

Tiles communicate physical identity.

They do not create it.

---

# Tiles Support Typography

Tiles also inherit editorial intent.

Examples.

Hero Tile.

↓

Heading.

Metadata Tile.

↓

Supporting.

Diagnostics Tile.

↓

Caption.

Editorial hierarchy therefore remains consistent throughout the platform.

---

# Tiles Support Motion

Tiles inherit Motion behaviour.

Examples.

Hero Tile.

↓

Hero Motion.

Timeline Tile.

↓

Supporting Motion.

Overlay Tile.

↓

Overlay Motion.

Motion therefore remains behaviourally consistent without components needing independent animation logic.

---

# Modules

Modules never define Tiles.

Modules contribute:

- behaviour,
- information,
- relationships.

The Composition Engine determines Expressions.

The Tile Framework determines Tiles.

This guarantees every module inherits the same presentation language.

---

# Good Examples

## Playback

Expression.

↓

Hero.

↓

Hero Tile.

↓

Platform Component.

The runtime architecture remains intact.

---

## Reading

Expression.

↓

Reading Progress.

↓

Progress Tile.

↓

Presentation.

The same Tile works across every reading experience.

---

## Music

Expression.

↓

Current Track.

↓

Hero Tile.

↓

Television Presentation.

Behaviour remains identical.

---

# Anti-patterns

## Component Tiles

Naming Tiles after widgets.

---

## Platform Tiles

Creating Flutter Tiles or React Tiles.

---

## Behavioural Tiles

Allowing Tiles to determine runtime hierarchy.

---

## Module Tiles

Modules introducing independent presentation primitives.

---

# Tile Philosophy Model

```mermaid
flowchart TD

Behaviour
Behaviour --> Expression
Expression --> Tile
Tile --> Component
Component --> Rendering
Rendering --> User
```

Tiles transform solved understanding into reusable physical presentation.

---

# Relationship To Future Chapters

The following chapters define how this philosophy becomes runtime architecture.

Including:

- Tile Taxonomy
- Expression Mapping
- Tile Lifecycle
- Adaptive Tiles
- Tile Composition
- Tile Interaction
- Runtime Tile Resolution

Every implementation should reinforce the philosophy established here.

---

# Summary

Tiles are the missing bridge between runtime understanding and visible interface.

They ensure that:

- behaviour remains behavioural,
- presentation remains reusable,
- rendering remains replaceable.

Components render Tiles.

Tiles communicate Expressions.

Expressions communicate the user's World.

That layered separation is the defining architectural principle of the Mosaic Tile Framework.
