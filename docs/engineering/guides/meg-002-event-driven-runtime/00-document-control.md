# Purpose

This document establishes the governance, authority and lifecycle of the Mosaic Event-Driven Runtime specification.

Version 0.3 aligns implementation guidance with [MIP-001](../../protocols/mip-001-event-protocol/index.md) event ownership, namespaced events and public/private Module event contracts.

MEG-002 defines the architectural standards governing how independently developed capabilities communicate and coordinate work within the Mosaic Runtime.

Unlike implementation documentation, this specification defines **runtime behaviour**, not implementation detail.

---

# Authority

MEG-002 is the authoritative specification governing event-driven behaviour throughout the Mosaic ecosystem.

This specification applies to:

- Mosaic Platform
- First-party Modules
- Third-party Modules
- Background Workers
- Schedulers
- Event Publishers
- Event Subscribers
- Runtime Infrastructure

Every component participating in the Mosaic Runtime MUST comply with the standards defined within this specification.

---

# Relationship to Other Specifications

MEG specifications intentionally build upon one another.

```mermaid

N1["MDL"]
N2["MDS"]
N3["MEG-001"]
N4["MEG-002"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
```

Specifically:

- **MDL** defines product philosophy.
- **MDS** defines presentation.
- **[MEG-001](../meg-001-go-engineering-standards/index.md)** defines engineering practices.
- **MEG-002** defines runtime behaviour.

Later MEG specifications build upon the runtime model introduced here.

# Normative Language

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the following keywords are interpreted according to RFC 2119.

| Keyword | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **MUST** | Mandatory requirement. |
| **MUST NOT** | Prohibited behaviour. |
| **SHOULD** | Strong recommendation. Deviation requires architectural justification. |
| **SHOULD NOT** | Discouraged except where clearly justified. |
| **MAY** | Optional behaviour based upon engineering judgement. |

Examples and diagrams are informative unless explicitly identified as normative.

# Runtime Principles

The Mosaic Runtime is built upon several foundational principles.

- Capabilities own behaviour.
- Events communicate facts.
- Dependencies remain explicit.
- Failures are expected.
- Components remain autonomous.
- Work is asynchronous by default.
- Runtime behaviour must be observable.
- Shutdown must be deterministic.

Every subsequent chapter expands one or more of these principles.

---

# Document Lifecycle

MEG specifications evolve alongside the platform.

Each document progresses through the following lifecycle.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Draft"]
N2["Review"]
N3["Accepted"]
N4["Implemented"]
N5["Maintained"]
N6["Superseded (optional)"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
```

Accepted specifications become part of the canonical Mosaic architecture.

Historical versions SHOULD remain available for future reference.

---

# Runtime Evolution

The runtime is expected to evolve.

However, architectural evolution should occur deliberately.

Changes affecting:

- event contracts
- event delivery guarantees
- runtime semantics
- lifecycle behaviour
- module interaction

SHOULD be accompanied by an Architectural Decision Record (ADR).

This ensures architectural intent remains discoverable long after implementation changes.

---

# Compliance

All runtime components SHOULD comply with MEG-002.

Where deviation becomes necessary, the repository SHOULD document:

- the reason
- expected impact
- migration strategy
- compatibility implications

Temporary deviations should eventually be removed.

Permanent deviations should generally result in updates to the specification.

---

# Design Philosophy

MEG-002 intentionally favours:

- deterministic behaviour
- loose coupling
- eventual consistency
- explicit ownership
- bounded complexity
- observable execution

The runtime should encourage independent capability evolution without sacrificing operational clarity.

This reflects established practice in mature event-driven systems, where idempotency, observability, ordering guarantees and bounded failure handling are treated as first-class architectural concerns rather than implementation details.

# Scope of Authority

MEG-002 governs runtime behaviour.

It does **not** define:

- business domains
- storage technologies
- transport protocols
- module packaging
- deployment architecture

Those concerns belong to other MEG specifications.

This separation keeps runtime concerns independent from implementation concerns.
