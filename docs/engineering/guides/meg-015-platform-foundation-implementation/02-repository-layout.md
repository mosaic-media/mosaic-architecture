# 02 — Repository Layout

---

# Package Tier Model

Implementation feedback from the first Platform build (`mosaic-platform`) showed that a flat two-tier split between `internal/platform/*` and `internal/adapters/*` does not distinguish a mandatory, Module-shaped built-in adapter (PostgreSQL) from genuinely internal, non-Module-shaped helpers (filesystem utilities, crypto helpers). The Platform repository therefore separates into three tiers of trust and delivery.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Core Platform — internal/platform/*"]
    B["Built-in module — internal/modules/*"]
    C["External module (future, per MEG-006)"]

    A -->|"defines contracts"| B
    B -->|"discovered the same way as"| C
```

**Core Platform** (`internal/platform/*`) — domain, contracts and application services. Fully trusted, compiled in, defines the rules everything else follows.

**Built-in module** (`internal/modules/*`) — infrastructure that implements Platform contracts using the same registration and manifest shape a future external Module would use ([MEG-006 — Module Platform](../meg-006-module-platform/index.md)), but compiled in, required and fully trusted — not sandboxed, not independently versioned, not optional. PostgreSQL is the first example: it lives at `internal/modules/postgres/`, registered through `internal/composition/builtin/` the same way an external Module would be discovered.

**External module** (future, per [MEG-006 — Module Platform](../meg-006-module-platform/index.md)) — product and domain capability packs (anime, manga, and so on). Governed, independently versioned, discovered at runtime. Not part of the Platform foundation's initial scaffold.

`internal/adapters/` is reserved for helpers that are **not** Module-shaped — code that does not implement a full contract surface on its own, such as filesystem utilities or crypto helpers. PostgreSQL, and any future built-in storage or eventing adapter, does not belong there.

# Initial Layout

The initial Go repository should separate public entry points, Core Platform code, built-in modules and future generated contracts.

```text
cmd/
  mosaic-platform/
    main.go
internal/
  platform/
    app/
    contracts/
    domain/
    runtime/
    policy/
    sessions/
    config/
    secrets/
    diagnostics/
  modules/
    postgres/
      migrations/
  adapters/
    filesystem/
    crypto/
  transport/
    graphql/
    health/
  composition/
    builtin/
contracts/
  platform/
    v1/
test/
  contract/
  integration/
  fixtures/
```

The exact names may change during implementation, but the tier model and dependency rules must not.

# Package Responsibilities

| Package area | Responsibility |
|--------------|----------------|
| `cmd/mosaic-platform` | Process entry point and dependency bootstrap only |
| `internal/platform/app` | Application services, transaction orchestration and command handling |
| `internal/platform/contracts` | Private contract definitions used before SDK extraction |
| `internal/platform/domain` | Platform domain types and invariants |
| `internal/platform/runtime` | Lifecycle, registry, startup and shutdown |
| `internal/platform/policy` | Permission decision and enforcement helpers |
| `internal/platform/sessions` | Session issuance, validation and revocation |
| `internal/platform/config` | Configuration schema, validation and activation |
| `internal/platform/secrets` | Secret access through broker interfaces |
| `internal/platform/diagnostics` | Health model, logs and redaction |
| `internal/modules/postgres` | Built-in PostgreSQL module: storage, migrations, outbox and the remaining Core Platform contracts it fulfils |
| `internal/adapters/filesystem` | Non-Module-shaped filesystem helpers |
| `internal/adapters/crypto` | Non-Module-shaped crypto helpers |
| `internal/transport/graphql` | GraphQL projection and command transport |
| `internal/transport/health` | Supervisor-facing health endpoints |
| `internal/composition/builtin` | Built-in module manifest, registration and discovery shape |
| `contracts/platform/v1` | Candidate source for generated SDK contracts |
| `test/contract` | Adapter contract tests reused across implementations |

---

# Dependency Direction

Implementation dependencies must point inward.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    T["Transport"]
    A["Application services"]
    C["Platform contracts"]
    D["Domain"]
    M["Built-in modules (PostgreSQL, ...)"]
    X["External systems"]

    T --> A
    A --> C
    A --> D
    M --> C
    M --> X
```

The domain must not import transport, module or database packages. Application services may depend on contracts, but not on concrete PostgreSQL (or other module) types. Built-in modules depend on Platform contracts and external systems; nothing in Core Platform depends on a built-in module.

---

# Public Surface Control

Only `contracts/platform/v1` may be treated as a candidate public contract source. Everything under `internal/` — Core Platform, built-in modules and adapters alike — is private and must not be imported by external Modules.

Before SDK generation exists, tests should enforce this with import checks.
