> *The Module Platform is built upon decades of experience in module architectures, capability systems and software platforms, adapted into a capability-oriented ecosystem for Mosaic.*

---

# Purpose

This document records the primary references that influenced the Module Platform described throughout MEG-006. Unlike a traditional module system, the Mosaic Module Platform combines ideas from several distinct traditions into a single platform model:

- Module Architecture
- Microkernel Architecture
- Capability-Oriented Design
- Manifest-Driven Platforms
- SDK Design
- Runtime Composition

The objective is not to imitate existing systems, but to adapt proven architectural principles into a platform capable of evolving for many years.

# Primary References

## Eclipse Module Architecture

The Eclipse Platform remains one of the most influential module architectures ever developed, and several of its concepts carry directly into MEG-006:

- module manifests
- module boundaries
- module registry
- runtime discovery
- deployment-time composition

Many architectural ideas behind capability discovery and registration align closely with Eclipse's module registry, although Mosaic replaces module boundaries with capability contracts.  [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Plug-in-architecture/plugin_architecture.html)

---

## Microkernel Architecture

Microkernel architecture strongly influenced several parts of the Mosaic design:

- Runtime Kernel
- Runtime Services
- Module isolation
- build-time capability composition

Within Mosaic the Runtime remains intentionally small and capabilities provide platform functionality, which mirrors the architectural philosophy of microkernel operating systems while adapting it to an application platform.

# Manifest-Driven Platforms

## Manifest-First Discovery

Modern module platforms increasingly use machine-readable manifests to separate the stages of bringing a module into a running system:

- discovery
- validation
- activation
- execution

That separation strongly influenced the Capability Manifest, Discovery, Registration and Dependency Resolution as MEG-006 defines them. Within Mosaic, manifests are therefore treated as architectural contracts rather than implementation details.  [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/modules/architecture-internals)

---

## Module Manifests

Modern browser module ecosystems demonstrate the value of declaring a module's intentions before any of its code runs:

- explicit permissions
- declarative metadata
- schema validation
- compatibility checking

Many permission and manifest concepts within MEG-006 were inspired by these approaches while remaining platform agnostic.  [emdashcms.org](https://emdashcms.org/learn/module-system)

---

# SDK Design

The Module SDK intentionally follows long-established SDK principles:

- stable contracts
- implementation hiding
- backwards compatibility
- explicit versioning

Together these mean the SDK should remain considerably more stable than the Runtime implementation beneath it, and that separation is what protects module authors from internal Runtime evolution.

---

# Dependency Management

Dependency Resolution within Mosaic draws inspiration from module systems that treat the dependency graph as something to be checked rather than discovered at runtime:

- validate dependency graphs
- detect cycles
- resolve versions
- construct activation order

The Runtime intentionally performs all of these operations before executing capability code.  [GitHub](https://ithub.global.ssl.fastly.net/open-gsd/gsd-core/blob/next/docs/reference/capability-manifest.md)

---

# Capability-Oriented Design

Although "Capability-Oriented Architecture" is not yet a widely standardised software architecture term, several modern platforms have independently converged upon similar ideas. Common themes include:

- capability discovery
- capability registries
- manifest-driven execution
- contract-based integration
- runtime validation

Mosaic extends these ideas into a unified Runtime Architecture centred around independently evolving business capabilities.  [Extentos](https://extentos.com/docs/concepts/capabilities)

## Domain-Driven Design

**Author**

Eric Evans

The Module Platform deliberately preserves the Domain boundaries defined in [MEG-003](../meg-003-domain-driven-design/index.md), so capabilities own:

- business behaviour
- business language
- business state

The Runtime owns execution and nothing more, which is what keeps a capability's business meaning independent of the mechanism that runs it.

---

## Hexagonal Architecture

**Author**

Alistair Cockburn

The Module Platform builds directly upon:

- Ports
- Adapters
- dependency inversion
- infrastructure isolation

Modules therefore communicate exclusively through Runtime contracts, and Runtime implementation remains hidden behind them.

---

## Clean Architecture

**Author**

Robert C. Martin

Referenced primarily for its treatment of:

- dependency direction
- policy vs implementation
- long-term maintainability

Many Runtime contracts intentionally reinforce these architectural principles.

# Platform Principles

The Module Platform established throughout MEG-006 intentionally builds upon several enduring architectural principles, which the references above informed but do not by themselves determine:

- The Runtime remains small.
- Capabilities provide business value.
- Discovery precedes execution.
- Manifests define contracts.
- SDKs hide implementation.
- Permissions follow least privilege.
- Dependencies remain explicit.
- Capabilities remain independently deployable.
- Built-in and module-delivered capabilities are architectural equals.
- Platform growth occurs through composition rather than modification.

These principles should remain considerably more stable than the implementation techniques used to realise them.

---

# Keeping References Current

Module platforms continue to evolve, marketplace ecosystems continue to mature and manifest standards continue to improve. This reference list should therefore be reviewed periodically to ensure:

- architectural guidance remains relevant
- obsolete practices are removed
- better ecosystem patterns are incorporated

The platform philosophy should nevertheless remain stable even as module technology evolves, because the principles recorded above outlast the systems that first demonstrated them.

---

# Closing Statement

MEG-006 intentionally does not describe a traditional module framework. It describes an ecosystem architecture built around independently evolving capabilities, and the resulting Module Platform therefore emphasises:

- capability-oriented design
- manifest-first discovery
- Runtime stability
- SDK contracts
- explicit permissions
- long-term ecosystem evolution

Every future capability should integrate into the platform by satisfying Runtime contracts rather than modifying Runtime implementation, because the Runtime provides execution while capabilities provide value. The platform exists so that those capabilities can continue evolving long after the Runtime itself has stabilised.
