# Purpose

This document establishes the governance, authority and lifecycle of the Mosaic Module Platform specification.

MEG-006 defines how independently developed capabilities become part of the Mosaic platform.

Unlike Runtime Architecture, which defines **how capabilities execute**, this specification defines:

- how capabilities are discovered
- how they are described
- how they are validated
- how they are composed into Platform packages
- how they become operational

The Module Platform is the mechanism through which the platform evolves without modifying the Platform.

Version 0.8 defines the Test Harness as a deterministic suite of development-only Modules, records event-simulation ownership and defers versioned Scenario Profiles pending a protocol decision.

---

# Authority

MEG-006 is the authoritative specification governing module development throughout the Mosaic ecosystem.

This specification applies to:

- Built-In Capabilities
- First-party Modules
- Third-party Modules
- Enterprise Modules
- SDK Development
- Developer Platform tooling
- Local Module development
- Test Harness Modules
- Test Harness deterministic datasets
- Test Harness event simulation
- deferred Scenario Profiles
- Marketplace Integration

Every capability intended to execute within the Mosaic Runtime SHOULD comply with this specification.

# Relationship to Other Specifications

MEG specifications intentionally build upon one another.

Specifically:

- **[MEG-001](../meg-001-go-engineering-standards/index.md)** defines engineering.
- **[MEG-002](../meg-002-event-driven-runtime/index.md)** defines runtime behaviour.
- **[MEG-003](../meg-003-domain-driven-design/index.md)** defines business modelling.
- **[MEG-004](../meg-004-hexagonal-architecture/index.md)** defines architectural boundaries.
- **[MEG-005](../meg-005-runtime-architecture/index.md)** defines the Capability Runtime.
- **MEG-006** defines how capabilities join that Runtime.

Together they establish the complete lifecycle of a Mosaic capability.

# Normative Language

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the following keywords are interpreted according to RFC 2119.

| Keyword | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **MUST** | Mandatory requirement. |
| **MUST NOT** | Prohibited behaviour. |
| **SHOULD** | Strong recommendation. Deviation requires architectural justification. |
| **SHOULD NOT** | Discouraged except where clearly justified. |
| **MAY** | Optional behaviour based upon engineering judgement. |

Examples and diagrams are informative unless explicitly identified as normative.

# Module Principles

The Mosaic Module Platform is built upon several foundational principles.

- Everything beyond the Runtime is a capability.
- Every capability is described by a manifest.
- Discovery precedes execution.
- Validation precedes activation.
- Module composition occurs at build time.
- Runtime plugins are prohibited.
- Runtime stability takes precedence over module flexibility.
- Capabilities remain independently deployable.
- Built-in and third-party capabilities are architectural equals.
- Modules evolve the platform without modifying the Runtime.

Every subsequent chapter expands one or more of these principles.

---

# Document Lifecycle

MEG specifications evolve alongside the platform.

Each document progresses through the following lifecycle.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Draft"]
N2["Review"]
N3["Accepted"]
N4["Implemented"]
N5["Maintained"]
N6["Superseded (optional)"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
```

Accepted specifications become part of the canonical Mosaic architecture.

Historical revisions SHOULD remain available for future reference.

---

# Platform Evolution

The Module Platform is expected to evolve.

However, changes affecting:

- capability manifests
- registration
- discovery
- dependency resolution
- permissions
- activation
- SDK contracts
- build-time composition
- generated imports
- Developer Platform boundaries
- local development composition
- testing and publication workflow ownership

SHOULD be accompanied by an Architectural Decision Record (ADR).

Platform evolution should remain deliberate and predictable.

---

# Compliance

All modules intended for the Mosaic Runtime SHOULD comply with MEG-006.

Where deviation becomes necessary, module authors SHOULD document:

- architectural reason
- compatibility impact
- migration strategy
- operational implications

The Runtime should remain capable of validating compliance before activation.

---

# Design Philosophy

MEG-006 intentionally favours:

- manifest-driven discovery
- explicit capability contracts
- deterministic build-time composition
- dependency validation
- runtime isolation
- version compatibility
- operational transparency

The Runtime should understand a module completely before executing it.

A machine-readable manifest describing identity, dependencies, permissions and capabilities has become the dominant approach for modern module ecosystems because it enables validation and discovery before code execution.  [Chrome for Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/modules/manifest)

# Scope of Authority

MEG-006 governs the Module Platform.

It does **not** define:

- business modelling
- runtime execution
- storage architecture
- deployment topology

Those concerns belong to other MEG specifications.

Keeping module concerns separate from runtime concerns allows both to evolve independently.
