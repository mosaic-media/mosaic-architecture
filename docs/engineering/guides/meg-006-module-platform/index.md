# MEG-006 — Module Platform

> *The Runtime provides execution. Modules provide evolution.*

---

# Purpose

The previous engineering specifications established:

- how software is written
- how the Runtime executes
- how the business is modelled
- how the Domain is protected
- how the Runtime itself is structured

MEG-006 answers the final architectural question.

> **How does the Platform evolve without modifying the Runtime?**

The Mosaic Module Platform allows new capabilities to be:

- discovered
- validated
- composed
- statically linked
- executed
- upgraded
- removed

without changing the Runtime itself.

Unlike traditional module systems, modules are not an afterthought.

They are a first-class architectural concept.

The Runtime is intentionally designed to grow through build-time Module composition rather than through continual modification of the Platform foundation.

[MEG-005](../meg-005-runtime-architecture/index.md) defines:

> **How the Runtime executes capabilities.**

MEG-006 defines:

> **How new capabilities become part of that Runtime.**

# Scope

This specification defines:

- Module philosophy
- Module lifecycle
- Module manifest
- Capability manifests
- Discovery
- Registration
- Activation
- Dependency resolution
- Module contracts
- Module permissions
- Configuration
- Versioning
- Compatibility
- Isolation
- SDK architecture
- Build-time composition
- Generated imports
- Developer Platform architecture
- Mosaic CLI workflow ownership
- Development Supervisor and Development Platform boundaries
- Test Harness Modules
- deterministic Test Harness data and event simulation
- local Module composition

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- business domains
- runtime internals
- storage architecture
- deployment topology
- Supervisor generation activation

Those concerns belong to previous or future MEG specifications.

# Guiding Question

MEG-006 exists to answer one question.

> **How should Mosaic evolve through independently developed capabilities while preserving Runtime stability?**

---

# Module Statement

Within Mosaic:

> **Everything beyond the Runtime is a capability. Every capability may be delivered as a module.**

Platform capabilities.

Third-party capabilities.

Enterprise capabilities.

Experimental capabilities.

The Runtime should treat them identically.

The only distinction should be **how they are delivered**, not **how they execute**.

Mosaic Modules are compile-time composition units.

They are not runtime plugins.

The finished product is always one statically linked Go executable.

---

# Module Architecture

Mosaic Module Architecture follows this shape.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Developer"]
N2["Mosaic CLI"]
N3["Mosaic SDK And Local Module"]
N4["Development Supervisor Or Production Supervisor"]
N5["Supervisor"]
N6["Build Workspace"]
N7["Mosaic Platform Binary"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
N6 --> N7
```

The Supervisor assembles the runtime from declarative manifests and Go modules.

The Build Pipeline performs build mechanics.

The Platform discovers registered Modules through the SDK registry at startup.

---

# Platform Hierarchy

The Mosaic platform intentionally separates concerns into architectural layers.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Supervisor"]
N2["Generation"]
N3["Platform Binary"]
N4["Runtime Kernel"]
N5["Runtime Services"]
N6["Capability Managers"]
N7["Module Capabilities"]
N8["Business Behaviour"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
N6 --> N7
N7 --> N8
```

Notice:

The Platform does not load runtime plugins.

It grows by composing selected Modules into a statically linked Platform Binary.

---

# Expected Outcome

After reading MEG-006 contributors should understand:

- how modules are discovered
- how capabilities register
- how manifests define platform contracts
- how dependencies are validated
- how Modules are composed into a Platform Binary
- how generated imports trigger registration
- why `imports.go` is the only generated integration source
- how local development compiles Modules through the Development Supervisor
- how Test Harness Modules support integration testing
- how permissions are enforced
- how modules evolve safely
- how built-in and third-party capabilities coexist

without modifying the Runtime itself.

# Design Goals

The Module Platform is intended to produce a platform that is:

- Extensible
- Discoverable
- Manifest driven
- Capability oriented
- Version aware
- Secure
- Replaceable
- Operationally predictable

Every module should feel like a natural part of the platform rather than an external add-on.

Manifest-driven discovery and registration allow capabilities to be discovered and validated before a Platform package is produced.  [zylos.ai](https://zylos.ai/research/2026-02-21-ai-agent-plugin-extension-architecture/)
