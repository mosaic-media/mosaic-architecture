# 02 — Source And Inputs

---

# Primary Source Selection

The engine should select exactly one logical primary Material-light source.

```text
if Focus references artwork:
    source = focused artwork
else if Hero references artwork:
    source = Hero artwork
else if a resolved co-brand illumination pair exists:
    source = static field from approved pair
else:
    source = static field from default Mosaic pair
```

Static pairs should use an approved Brand Illumination Pair and a page-level Static Brand Emitter.

The emitter supplies normalised `x` and `y` placement plus bounded logical `z` in the Composition Space parent.

The Material System continues to own intensity, falloff, diffusion and transition rules.

The client should generate and cache the resulting low-resolution field deterministically.

It does not require artwork analysis, a serialised `UVLightFrame` or a `.mos` resource.

A Focus transition should blend from the previous stable field to the new field rather than clear Acrylic state immediately.

The blend remains a transition between sources, not a permanent multi-source lighting model.

# Engine Inputs

| Input | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| Material identity | Selects the governed Acrylic profile. |
| Focus and Hero state | Selects the primary artwork source. |
| `UVLightField` | Supplies temporally reconstructed relative radiance. |
| Brand Illumination Pair | Supplies a stable synthetic field when focused and Hero artwork are absent. |
| Static Brand Emitter | Positions the synthetic field using normalised `x`, `y` and bounded logical `z` in the Composition Space parent. |
| Surface transform | Supplies `x`, `y`, `z`, scale and orientation. |
| Surface bounds and mask | Defines the two-dimensional Acrylic region. |
| Z-order and opaque masks | Defines local backdrop and occlusion relationships. |
| Apparent thickness | Governs diffusion, displacement, edge response and optical parallax. |
| Runtime Atmosphere | Constrains source influence. |
| Accessibility | Constrains motion, translucency, contrast and distortion. |
| Renderer Capability Profile | Describes available techniques and measured cost. |
| Dynamic Material Budget | Limits work safe for the current frame. |
| User Fidelity Maximum | Caps Refraction at Automatic, Balanced or Essential before runtime degradation. |

# Backdrop Input

The engine should treat visible Presentation behind Acrylic as a receiver-local input.

Backdrop sampling provides:

- local colour continuity
- translucency
- diffusion
- bounded displacement
- internal parallax

It does not replace or modify `UVLightField`.

A renderer that cannot sample the actual backdrop should preserve Acrylic identity using a stable tint, diffusion approximation and artwork-derived edge response.

# Source Transition State

A source transition should retain:

- previous field identity
- next field identity
- transition progress
- last stable resolved state

The engine should cancel obsolete intermediate analysis when Focus moves again and transition toward the latest useful source.
