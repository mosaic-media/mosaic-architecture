# Document Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Document | MEG-014 |
| Title | Refraction Engine |
| Status | Draft |
| Version | 0.1 |
| Owner | AdamNi-7080 |
| Audience | Web, native-client, media-pipeline and renderer engineers |
| Classification | Engineering specification |
| Scope | Client-side Acrylic and Refraction implementation guidance |

---

# Authority

MEG-014 owns implementation guidance for:

- Refraction Engine boundaries
- source and Composition inputs
- coordinate and projection mathematics
- resolved Acrylic state
- three-layer Acrylic processing
- fixed apparent-thickness preservation
- renderer-independent processing
- renderer profiles
- fidelity degradation and overdraw governance
- scheduling and degradation
- engine diagnostics and testing

It does not own:

- Material visual meaning
- `UVLightFrame` serialisation
- Runtime SDUI component contracts
- video decoding

---

# Maturity

Version 0.1 is the first complete engineering design.

It requires prototype measurements before technical review, particularly for CSS filter cost, renderer crossover points, video sampling cadence and [MIP-003](../../protocols/mip-003-uv-light-frame-protocol/index.md) payload choices.
