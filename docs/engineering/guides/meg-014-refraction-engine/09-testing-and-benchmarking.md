# 09 — Testing And Benchmarking

---

# Conformance Testing

Engine tests should verify:

- focused artwork overrides Hero artwork
- Hero artwork is used when Focus has no artwork
- an approved Brand Illumination Pair is used when focused and Hero artwork are absent
- the default Mosaic pair is used when no approved pair exists
- source transitions do not flash or reset Acrylic
- backdrop pixels remain receiver-local
- non-overlapping nearby Acrylic may couple
- distant or occluded Acrylic does not couple
- energy decreases through secondary transport
- parallax reacts to Composition movement, scrolling and Focus transitions
- pointer, gyro and device tilt do not drive parallax
- highlight rotation follows the canonical quadrant and angle convention
- receiver motion changes its artwork-UV sampling window without invalidating the source frame
- a Static Brand Emitter produces a stable procedural field at the configured Composition Space position
- scrolling, Focus changes and receiver motion move sampling windows without rebuilding the static brand field
- Brand Illumination Pair, emitter-position, appearance-mode and parent-dimension changes invalidate the static brand field
- optical displacement never reveals an empty or uncaptured area inside the Acrylic mask
- every semantic role resolves the same fixed apparent-thickness profile
- tint is the only authored Acrylic Material parameter
- the Rear Optical Plane preserves enough structured detail to make displacement observable without uniform frost
- the Acrylic Volume inherits incident source hue and carries contour ingress inward
- the Front Surface response follows straight and curved contour geometry without a detached stroke or thick bezel
- Enhanced, Balanced and Essential retain the same three-layer Material meaning
- Essential fidelity retains cached artwork-derived colour when source data is available
- user fidelity preference acts as a maximum and never forces work above safe budget
- nested Acrylic does not create unbounded backdrop-filter stacking
- invalid frames preserve the last stable state
- video presentation never waits for Refraction work

# Visual Fixtures

The test set should include:

- bright point against dark artwork
- broad low-contrast artwork
- saturated artwork beside neutral Acrylic
- transparent artwork regions
- rounded and irregular Acrylic masks
- overlapping opaque and Acrylic surfaces
- nearby non-overlapping Acrylic
- Focus transitions between artworks
- static brand fields at corner, edge and central emitter positions
- structured grids and high-contrast backdrop boundaries for displacement calibration
- warm and cool sources approaching straight edges and rounded corners
- neutral, dark and saturated Material tints under the same incident field
- static and moving artwork
- reduced-motion and high-contrast states

Golden images should validate perceptual invariants rather than exact equality across rendering backends.

# Performance Benchmarks

Benchmarks should measure:

- [MIP-003](../../protocols/mip-003-uv-light-frame-protocol/index.md) decode and validation
- 32-, 64- and 128-texel analysis candidates
- binary16 and alternative runtime precision
- unsupercompressed and Zstandard cache payloads
- CSS layer and backdrop-filter cost
- filtered pixel area and backdrop nesting depth
- Flutter composite and fragment cost
- two-dimensional shader crossover points
- Acrylic receiver and proximity-relationship scaling
- static and video update cadence
- profile-switch hysteresis
- Enhanced, Balanced and Essential fidelity residency
- memory and upload pressure

---

# Playback Gate

A benchmark run is not acceptable when Refraction causes a presentation deadline miss, even if average frame rate remains high.

Tests should report:

- presented video frames
- dropped video frames
- Refraction-attributable drops
- worst and percentile frame time
- skipped Material updates
- stable-state reuse

---

# Technical Review Inputs

Prototype evidence should determine whether to retain or revise:

- the [MIP-003](../../protocols/mip-003-uv-light-frame-protocol/index.md) 64-texel longest edge
- `RGBA16F` canonical payload
- complete mip-chain requirement
- optional Zstandard compression
- default video polling ranges
- CSS Composite as the default web path
- refractive-index approximation and one-centimetre optical-reference mapping
- rear-plane displacement and maximum safe offset
- backdrop transmission and structured-detail retention
- Volume absorption, scattering, pigmentation strength and inward falloff
- tint luminance and chroma transmission limits
- contour ingress strength, length, curved-corner wrapping and far-edge attenuation
- Front Surface Fresnel, specular and reflection response
- cross-layer parallax ratios and overscan margins
- concentrated peak-energy tone mapping and bloom thresholds

Documentation should remain Draft until those decisions receive technical review.
