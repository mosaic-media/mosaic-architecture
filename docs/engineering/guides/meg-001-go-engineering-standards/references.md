# Purpose

The Mosaic Engineering Guidelines (MEG) build upon decades of software engineering experience.

This document records the primary references that informed the standards defined throughout MEG-001.

These references should be considered recommended reading for contributors wishing to deepen their understanding of Go and software architecture.

The MEG is intentionally opinionated.

However, those opinions are derived from established engineering principles rather than invented in isolation.

# Software Engineering References

## Clean Architecture

**Author**

Robert C. Martin

**Topics**

- Dependency direction
- Architectural boundaries
- Separation of concerns

---

## Clean Code

**Author**

Robert C. Martin

**Topics**

- Readability
- Naming
- Functions
- Refactoring

While several examples are Java-centric, many of the underlying engineering principles remain valuable.

Individual implementation patterns should always be adapted to idiomatic Go.

---

## Domain-Driven Design

**Author**

Eric Evans

**Topics**

- Domain modelling
- Ubiquitous language
- Bounded contexts
- Aggregates

The strategic concepts remain highly relevant.

Implementation techniques should follow Go idioms rather than object-oriented conventions.

---

## Refactoring

**Author**

Martin Fowler

**Topics**

- Incremental improvement
- Code smells
- Continuous evolution
- Technical debt reduction

This work strongly aligns with the Boy Scout Rule adopted throughout the MEG.

---

## The Pragmatic Programmer

**Authors**

Andrew Hunt

David Thomas

**Topics**

- Software craftsmanship
- Continuous improvement
- Engineering discipline

Many of the engineering attitudes reflected within the MEG originate from this work.

---

## Designing Data-Intensive Applications

**Author**

Martin Kleppmann

**Topics**

- Distributed systems
- Data consistency
- Event-driven systems
- Storage architecture
- Scalability

Strongly recommended reading for engineers working on distributed Mosaic services.

---

# Architecture References

The following architectural concepts influence the Mosaic ecosystem.

- Event-Driven Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Ports and Adapters
- CQRS (where appropriate)
- Stale-While-Revalidate
- Repository Pattern
- Worker Pool Pattern
- Pipeline Pattern

Mosaic intentionally adopts concepts rather than frameworks.

Architectural ideas should always be evaluated through the lens of simplicity and maintainability.

---

# Concurrency References

Recommended reading.

## Go Concurrency Patterns

The Go Team

Topics include:

- Pipelines
- Cancellation
- Fan-out
- Fan-in

https://go.dev/blog/pipelines

---

## Share Memory By Communicating

The Go Team

Introduces Go's concurrency philosophy.

https://go.dev/blog/share-memory-by-communicating

---

## The Context Package

The Go Team

Introduces structured cancellation throughout Go applications.

# Keeping References Current

Engineering practices evolve.

Languages evolve.

Tooling evolves.

This document SHOULD be reviewed periodically to ensure referenced material remains:

- relevant
- accessible
- authoritative

Where better references become available, they should replace older material while preserving the engineering philosophy established throughout the MEG.

---

# Closing Statement

The Mosaic Engineering Guidelines do not exist to replace established software engineering knowledge.

They exist to curate, refine and adapt that knowledge into a consistent set of standards for the Mosaic platform.

Contributors are encouraged to understand not only **what** these standards require, but also **why** they exist.

Engineering judgement will always remain more valuable than memorising rules.
