# Storage Lifecycle

> *Information changes throughout its lifetime. Storage should evolve with it rather than treating every piece of data as permanent.*

---

# Purpose

Information within Mosaic is not static.

Media is:

- discovered
- imported
- enriched
- consumed
- archived
- eventually removed

During that lifecycle, information naturally moves between storage systems.

Examples include:

- PostgreSQL
- DuckDB
- Blob Storage
- MOS Cache
- MOS Archives

The Storage Lifecycle defines how information flows between these systems while preserving:

- ownership
- consistency
- recoverability

---

# Philosophy

Within Mosaic:

> **Information should move because its lifecycle changes, not because its storage technology changes.**

Every storage transition should represent a meaningful change in the information itself.

Storage should follow information.

Never dictate it.

---

# Information Lifecycle

Every piece of information progresses through a common lifecycle.

```text
Discovered

↓

Imported

↓

Enriched

↓

Active

↓

Referenced

↓

Archived

↓

Deleted
```

Different storage systems participate at different stages.

---

# Discovery

Initially.

```text
External Source

↓

Metadata

↓

Capability
```

At this stage:

Information may exist only:

- remotely
- temporarily
- in memory

No permanent persistence has yet occurred.

---

# Import

Import creates Business State.

Typical flow.

```text
Media Source

↓

Repository

↓

PostgreSQL
```

Business information now becomes durable.

Import should establish:

- ownership
- identity
- relationships

Everything afterwards builds upon this foundation.

---

# Enrichment

Following import:

Additional information may be collected.

Examples include:

- metadata
- artwork
- provider mappings
- recommendations

Typical flow.

```text
PostgreSQL

↓

Metadata Capability

↓

DuckDB

↓

Blob Storage

↓

MOS Cache
```

Business State remains authoritative.

Enrichment produces supporting information.

---

# Active State

During normal operation:

Information exists simultaneously across multiple storage systems.

Example.

```text
PostgreSQL

↓

Business Truth
```

```text
DuckDB

↓

Analytics
```

```text
Blob Storage

↓

Artwork
```

```text
MOS Cache

↓

Resolved Metadata
```

Every storage system owns its own responsibility.

No duplication of authority occurs.

---

# Runtime Consumption

Capabilities consume information through repositories.

Typical flow.

```text
Capability

↓

Repository

↓

PostgreSQL

↓

Blob Storage

↓

MOS Cache
```

Storage remains invisible.

Capabilities consume business concepts.

Not storage technologies.

---

# Derived Information

Derived information appears after business information exists.

Examples include:

- search indexes
- recommendation vectors
- artwork manifests
- provider mappings

These datasets are created.

Never authored.

Their lifecycle depends entirely upon the authoritative information from which they originate.

---

# Cache Lifecycle

Cache follows its own lifecycle.

```text
Generate

↓

Use

↓

Invalidate

↓

Delete

↓

Regenerate
```

Notice:

Deletion is expected.

Business correctness should never depend upon cache persistence.

---

# Binary Lifecycle

Binary assets follow a distinct lifecycle.

```text
Download

↓

Blob Storage

↓

Reference

↓

Cache

↓

Archive

↓

Delete
```

Binary assets remain independent of:

- Runtime execution
- analytical processing

They simply become referenced resources.

---

# Analytical Lifecycle

Analytical information progresses differently.

```text
Business Events

↓

DuckDB

↓

Aggregation

↓

Reports

↓

Recommendation Inputs
```

Analytics evolve continuously.

They should never become authoritative.

---

# Archive Lifecycle

MOS Archives exist for long-term portability.

Typical lifecycle.

```text
Business State

↓

Export

↓

MOS Archive

↓

Transport

↓

Import

↓

Business State
```

The archive remains independent of:

- Runtime
- deployment
- storage implementation

Its purpose is preservation.

---

# Deletion

Deletion should follow ownership.

Examples.

Business entity deleted.

↓

Blob references removed.

↓

Derived caches invalidated.

↓

Analytical datasets rebuilt.

↓

Unused blobs collected.

Deletion should proceed from:

Authoritative.

↓

Derived.

Never the reverse.

---

# Garbage Collection

Derived information SHOULD be collected automatically.

Examples include:

- orphaned blobs
- expired caches
- obsolete search indexes
- unused previews

Business information should never be removed by garbage collection.

Only information that is safely reproducible.

---

# Migration

Storage migration should preserve lifecycle.

Example.

```text
PostgreSQL

↓

New Version
```

Business State survives.

Likewise.

```text
Blob Storage

↓

New Provider
```

Blob identity remains unchanged.

Lifecycle remains stable.

Implementation evolves.

---

# Backup

Backup priorities follow storage classes.

Highest priority.

- Business State
- Archive Data

Lower priority.

- Binary Assets (depending upon regeneration policy)

Lowest priority.

- Derived Assets
- MOS Cache

The platform should avoid backing up information that is cheaper to rebuild.

---

# Recovery

Recovery should mirror lifecycle.

```text
Restore Business State

↓

Restore Archives

↓

Restore Blob References

↓

Rebuild DuckDB

↓

Rebuild MOS Cache

↓

Resume Runtime
```

Recovery should never require restoring analytical or cached datasets.

The Runtime should regenerate them automatically.

---

# Storage Transitions

Transitions between storage systems should always be explicit.

Example.

```text
Business Event

↓

Analytics Pipeline

↓

DuckDB
```

Rather than.

```text
Database Trigger

↓

Hidden Write
```

Storage transitions should remain:

- observable
- deterministic
- reviewable

---

# Lifecycle Ownership

Every lifecycle transition has exactly one owner.

Examples.

Import.

↓

Repository.

Enrichment.

↓

Capability.

Analytics.

↓

Analytics Capability.

Archive.

↓

Export Service.

Ownership prevents duplicated persistence behaviour.

---

# Event-Driven Storage

Storage transitions SHOULD be event driven.

Example.

```text
MediaImported

↓

Metadata Capability

↓

Blob Storage

↓

MOS Cache

↓

DuckDB
```

Each capability reacts independently.

The Storage Architecture naturally complements the Runtime Architecture established in MEG-002 and MEG-005.

---

# Observability

The Storage Lifecycle SHOULD expose:

- imports
- enrichments
- cache rebuilds
- archive exports
- garbage collection
- recovery

Operators should always understand:

> **Where is this information within its lifecycle?**

---

# Anti-Patterns

The following practices are prohibited.

## Cache Before Business

Generating derived information before Business State exists.

---

## Shared Lifecycle Ownership

Multiple capabilities managing the same storage transition.

---

## Permanent Cache

Treating MOS Cache as authoritative.

---

## Hidden Storage Writes

Storage transitions occurring without Runtime visibility.

---

## Analytics Before Import

Generating analytical datasets before business information exists.

---

## Archive As Database

Using MOS Archives as primary Runtime persistence.

---

# Mosaic Guidelines

Within Mosaic:

- Storage transitions MUST follow information lifecycle.
- Business State MUST precede derived information.
- Cache SHOULD remain disposable.
- Archives MUST remain portable.
- Analytics SHOULD remain reproducible.
- Storage transitions SHOULD remain event driven.
- Every lifecycle transition MUST have one owner.
- Recovery SHOULD rebuild derived storage automatically.

---

# Relationship to MEG

Repositories explain:

> **How the Domain persists information.**

The Storage Lifecycle explains:

> **How that information evolves across storage systems over time.**

The next chapter introduces **Migrations**, defining how storage schemas, archive formats and persistence technologies evolve while preserving long-term compatibility.

---

# Summary

Storage is not static.

Information moves.

It matures.

It becomes enriched.

It is archived.

Eventually it disappears.

Within Mosaic, every storage transition should reflect a genuine change in the information itself while preserving one constant principle:

> **Authoritative information leads. Derived information follows.**

That simple rule keeps the entire Storage Architecture predictable, recoverable and easy to evolve.
