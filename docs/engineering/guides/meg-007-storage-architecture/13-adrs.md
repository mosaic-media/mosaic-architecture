# Architectural Decision Guidance

> *Decision history belongs in decision records. This chapter identifies when MEG-007 needs them and where readers should look for the governing process.*

---

# Purpose

MEG-007 may require architecture decisions when changes alter long-lived engineering direction, compatibility expectations or responsibility boundaries.

The decision process itself is governed by **MDG-001 — Documentation Authority Guide**.

This chapter avoids repeating ADR process rules so the documentation library has one authoritative home for decision practice.

---

# Decision Areas

Create or update a decision record when a change affects:

- Polyglot Persistence
- Business State In PostgreSQL
- DuckDB For Analytics
- MOS Archive Format
- MOS Cache Strategy
- Blob Identifier Design
- Repository Ownership
- Backup Strategy

---

# Relationship To MDG-001

MDG-001 defines ADR structure, review expectations, lifecycle and cross-reference rules.

This guide should reference decisions that affect it, but should not redefine the decision process.

---

# Review Guidance

During review, confirm that the guide and any related decision record agree.

If a decision changes the meaning of this guide, update the affected chapter and reference the decision from this page.
