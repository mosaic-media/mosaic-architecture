# Isolation

> *Capabilities should collaborate. They should never become dependent upon one another's implementation.*

---

# Purpose

The Mosaic Runtime is designed to execute many independent capabilities.

Examples include:

- Playback
- Library
- Metadata
- Recommendations
- Books
- Music
- Anime
- IPTV

Each capability should remain independently:

- developed
- deployed
- upgraded
- tested
- replaced

Without effective isolation:

- failures propagate
- upgrades become risky
- Runtime stability degrades
- platform evolution slows

Isolation is therefore one of the defining architectural principles of the Extension Platform.

---

# Philosophy

Within Mosaic:

> **Capabilities may communicate. They must never become coupled.**

Isolation does **not** mean capabilities never interact.

It means:

Interactions occur only through Runtime contracts.

Implementation remains private.

---

# Isolation Layers

Capability isolation exists across several dimensions.

```
Lifecycle

↓

Execution

↓

Contracts

↓

Dependencies

↓

Configuration

↓

Permissions

↓

Failure
```

Each layer protects one aspect of platform independence.

---

# Lifecycle Isolation

Every capability owns its own lifecycle.

Example.

```
Metadata

↓

Activated
```

does not imply:

```
Recommendations

↓

Activated
```

The Runtime coordinates lifecycle.

Capabilities participate independently.

One capability should never activate another.

---

# Execution Isolation

Every capability executes independently.

Example.

```
Metadata

↓

Worker A
```

```
Playback

↓

Worker B
```

Execution failure within one capability should not directly affect unrelated capability execution.

The Worker Manager and Execution Engine cooperate to preserve this separation.

---

# Failure Isolation

Suppose:

```
Metadata Capability

↓

Failure
```

The Runtime should ensure:

- Playback continues.
- Library continues.
- Authentication continues.

Failure should remain local.

System-wide failure should be exceptional.

This principle of fault isolation is a cornerstone of resilient plugin and microkernel architectures. ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/bulkhead.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

---

# Dependency Isolation

Capabilities should depend only upon:

- Runtime contracts
- declared capability contracts

They should never depend upon:

- implementation packages
- internal data structures
- private APIs

Dependencies should remain explicit and manifest-driven.

---

# Contract Isolation

Capabilities communicate through contracts.

Example.

```
Metadata Capability

↓

MetadataProvider

↓

Playback Capability
```

Playback depends upon:

```
MetadataProvider
```

It does not depend upon:

```
TMDB Implementation
```

Contract isolation allows implementations to evolve independently.

---

# Event Isolation

Events reinforce capability isolation.

Example.

```
PlaybackCompleted

↓

Runtime

↓

Recommendation Capability
```

Playback does not know:

- who subscribed
- what happened afterwards

Events communicate business facts.

The Runtime provides delivery.

Capabilities remain autonomous.

---

# State Isolation

Each capability owns its own business state.

Example.

```
Playback

↓

Watch Progress
```

```
Metadata

↓

Artwork
```

Playback should never modify Metadata storage directly.

Communication occurs through:

- contracts
- events

Never shared persistence.

This aligns with the ownership principles established in MEG-003.

---

# Storage Isolation

Capabilities should not share persistence implementation.

Poor.

```
Playback

↓

Update Metadata Table
```

Preferred.

```
PlaybackCompleted

↓

Runtime

↓

Metadata Reacts
```

Storage ownership follows capability ownership.

---

# Configuration Isolation

Capabilities consume only their own configuration.

Poor.

```
Metadata

↓

Reads Playback Configuration
```

Preferred.

```
Metadata

↓

Own Configuration
```

Shared configuration creates hidden dependencies.

The Runtime should inject configuration independently.

---

# Permission Isolation

Permissions are capability specific.

Example.

```
Metadata

↓

blob.read
```

does not imply:

```
Playback

↓

blob.read
```

Authority should remain local to the capability requesting it.

Permission isolation complements execution isolation.

---

# Runtime Isolation

Capabilities should remain unaware of:

- worker identity
- scheduler implementation
- queue topology
- execution engine

The Runtime remains infrastructure.

Capabilities consume Runtime services.

They never manage them.

---

# SDK Isolation

Extensions interact only with the SDK.

They should never import:

- Runtime internals
- Kernel implementation
- Runtime Services

The SDK forms the isolation boundary between Runtime evolution and extension stability.

---

# Resource Isolation

Capabilities consume Runtime resources.

They do not own them.

Examples include:

- workers
- memory
- scheduling
- connections

The Runtime may:

- limit
- prioritise
- reclaim

resources independently of capability implementation.

No capability should monopolise shared Runtime resources.

---

# Upgrade Isolation

Capabilities should upgrade independently.

Example.

```
Metadata

↓

Version 2.1
```

should not require:

```
Playback

↓

Upgrade
```

unless an explicit dependency requires it.

Version coupling should remain intentional.

Not accidental.

---

# Extension Isolation

Third-party extensions should remain isolated from:

- Core implementation
- other extensions
- Runtime internals

Architecturally.

```
Runtime

↓

SDK

↓

Extension
```

Extensions communicate with the platform.

Never with one another's private implementation.

---

# Security Isolation

Isolation contributes directly to Runtime security.

Even if an extension behaves incorrectly:

It should remain constrained by:

- permissions
- contracts
- Runtime boundaries

Isolation reduces both accidental and malicious platform impact.

---

# Operational Isolation

Operational behaviour should also remain isolated.

Examples include:

- logging
- metrics
- tracing
- health

Each capability reports independently.

The Runtime aggregates operational information without coupling implementations.

---

# Marketplace Isolation

Marketplace installation should preserve isolation.

Installing:

```
Books Capability
```

should not modify:

```
Playback Capability
```

Existing capabilities remain unchanged.

The platform simply gains additional functionality.

This is one of the defining characteristics of a capability-oriented platform.

---

# Diagnostics

The Runtime SHOULD expose:

- capability dependencies
- resource consumption
- failure boundaries
- permission grants
- execution isolation

Operators should understand:

> **Which capability affected which part of the platform?**

Isolation should remain observable.

---

# Anti-Patterns

The following practices are prohibited.

## Shared Business State

Multiple capabilities directly modifying the same business data.

---

## Private API Usage

Capabilities importing implementation packages from other capabilities.

---

## Runtime Bypass

Capabilities communicating directly without Runtime contracts.

---

## Shared Configuration

Capabilities reading one another's configuration.

---

## Shared Permissions

Granting one capability authority because another requires it.

---

## Cross-Capability Lifecycle

Capabilities activating, stopping or restarting one another.

---

# Mosaic Guidelines

Within Mosaic:

- Capabilities MUST remain operationally isolated.
- Business state MUST remain capability owned.
- Communication MUST occur through Runtime contracts or events.
- Runtime Services MUST preserve execution isolation.
- Permissions MUST remain capability specific.
- Configuration MUST remain capability specific.
- Extensions MUST remain independent of Runtime implementation.
- Failure SHOULD remain local wherever practical.

---

# Relationship to MEG

Versioning defines:

> **Whether capabilities are compatible.**

Isolation defines:

> **How compatible capabilities safely coexist inside one Runtime.**

The next chapter introduces **Platform Guidelines**, bringing together the principles of the Extension Platform into practical guidance for engineers designing new capabilities.

---

# Summary

Isolation is one of the defining architectural properties of the Mosaic platform.

It allows:

- Core capabilities
- first-party extensions
- third-party extensions

to coexist within one Runtime while remaining independently evolvable.

By isolating:

- lifecycle
- execution
- state
- permissions
- configuration
- failures

the Runtime becomes a stable platform rather than a tightly coupled application.
