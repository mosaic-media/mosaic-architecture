# Activation

> *A registered capability exists. An activated capability participates.*

---

# Purpose

Following:

- discovery
- registration
- dependency resolution

the Runtime possesses a validated capability graph.

However:

No executable capability has yet joined the Runtime.

Activation is the controlled transition from:

```
Known Capability
```

to:

```
Operational Capability
```

Activation is therefore the moment a capability becomes part of the live platform.

---

# Philosophy

Within Mosaic:

> **Activation is deliberate. It is never implicit.**

Capabilities should activate only when:

- dependencies are satisfied
- permissions are approved
- configuration is valid
- Runtime resources are available

Activation should never occur simply because code exists.

---

# Activation Pipeline

Every capability follows the same activation sequence.

```
Registered

↓

Dependencies Satisfied

↓

Permissions Granted

↓

Configuration Valid

↓

Instantiate Capability

↓

Register Runtime Contracts

↓

Ready

↓

Running
```

Activation is the first stage where executable code participates.

Everything beforehand is metadata driven.

---

# Why Activation Exists

Without activation:

```
Capability

↓

Execute Immediately
```

The Runtime loses the opportunity to:

- validate
- observe
- reject
- coordinate

Instead.

```
Capability

↓

Activation

↓

Operational Runtime
```

The Runtime remains in control of platform composition.

---

# Activation Is Runtime Controlled

Capabilities should never activate themselves.

Poor.

```go
func init() {

    start()

}
```

Preferred.

```
Runtime

↓

Activate Capability

↓

Capability Ready
```

Lifecycle ownership belongs entirely to the Runtime.

Capabilities participate.

They do not control.

---

# Activation Prerequisites

Before activation begins, the Runtime MUST verify:

- registration completed
- dependency graph resolved
- version compatibility satisfied
- permissions approved
- configuration validated

If any prerequisite fails:

Activation must not begin.

Failing capabilities should remain inactive rather than partially operational.

---

# Capability Construction

Activation is responsible for constructing the capability instance.

Conceptually.

```
Runtime

↓

Composition Root

↓

Capability

↓

Runtime Contracts

↓

Ready
```

Construction should occur only once.

Repeated activation should create a new capability instance only after a complete deactivation cycle.

---

# Runtime Contracts

During activation, the Runtime provides:

- scheduler access
- execution services
- configuration
- observability
- lifecycle notifications

Capabilities receive Runtime contracts through dependency injection.

They should never discover Runtime Services dynamically.

---

# Lifecycle Hooks

Capabilities MAY expose lifecycle hooks.

Conceptually.

```text
Initialise()

Start()

Stop()

Dispose()
```

These hooks belong to capability lifecycle.

They should not perform registration or dependency resolution.

The Runtime already completed those phases.

The capability simply prepares itself to execute.

---

# Readiness

Activation should distinguish between:

```
Initialised
```

and

```
Ready
```

A capability becomes:

```
Ready
```

only after:

- resources allocated
- Runtime contracts injected
- internal initialisation completed

Only then may the Runtime dispatch work.

Separating activation from readiness avoids dispatching work before a capability has completed its own initialisation.  [oai_citation:0‡DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/antfu/vscode-open-in-github-button/2.1-extension-lifecycle-and-activation?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

# Activation Order

Activation follows the validated Capability Graph.

Example.

```
Library

↓

Metadata

↓

Playback

↓

Recommendations
```

The Runtime should never activate:

```
Recommendations
```

before:

```
Playback
```

Dependency order remains authoritative.

---

# Parallel Activation

Independent capabilities SHOULD activate concurrently.

Example.

```
Playback
```

and

```
Authentication
```

may activate simultaneously if no dependency exists.

Parallel activation should never violate dependency ordering.

---

# Activation Failure

Suppose activation fails.

```
Capability

↓

Activation

↓

Failure
```

The Runtime should:

- report the failure
- release allocated resources
- mark capability unavailable
- continue only if platform integrity remains intact

Activation should never leave partially initialised capabilities inside the Runtime.

---

# Partial Platform Activation

The Runtime MAY continue operating when optional capabilities fail activation.

Example.

```
Recommendation Capability

↓

Activation Failure
```

The platform may continue providing:

- playback
- metadata
- libraries

Critical capability failures, however, SHOULD prevent Runtime startup.

Capability criticality should be declared within the manifest.

---

# Activation Events

The Runtime MAY publish Runtime Events.

Examples include:

```
CapabilityActivating
```

```
CapabilityActivated
```

```
CapabilityActivationFailed
```

These events improve observability.

They do not represent business behaviour.

---

# Runtime Visibility

Operators should be able to answer:

- Which capabilities are active?
- Which failed activation?
- Why?
- Which dependencies blocked activation?

Activation should remain completely observable.

Hidden activation behaviour complicates operations.

---

# Lazy Activation

The Runtime MAY support lazy activation.

Example.

```
Capability Installed

↓

Registered

↓

Inactive

↓

First Request

↓

Activated
```

Lazy activation should remain an explicit Runtime policy.

Capabilities should not determine their own activation strategy.

---

# Activation And Extensions

Core and third-party capabilities activate identically.

```
Core Capability

↓

Activation
```

```
Extension Capability

↓

Activation
```

The Runtime should not distinguish between them.

Architectural equality remains one of the defining principles of the platform.

---

# Deactivation

Activation always implies the possibility of deactivation.

```
Activated

↓

Running

↓

Stopping

↓

Disposed
```

Every activated capability should support a graceful lifecycle.

Future chapters define lifecycle behaviour in greater detail.

---

# Security

Activation should occur only after:

- permission approval
- dependency validation
- configuration validation

Execution should never begin before these Runtime guarantees have been satisfied.

Trust should be established before activation.

Not afterwards.

---

# Anti-Patterns

The following practices are prohibited.

## Self Activation

Capabilities activating themselves.

---

## Hidden Initialisation

Background work beginning during object construction.

---

## Activation Before Validation

Executing capability code before dependency or permission checks.

---

## Partial Activation

Leaving half-initialised capabilities registered.

---

## Runtime Discovery During Activation

Capabilities dynamically searching for Runtime Services.

---

## Business Behaviour During Activation

Executing business workflows as part of capability startup.

Activation prepares the capability.

It does not perform business work.

---

# Mosaic Guidelines

Within Mosaic:

- Activation MUST remain Runtime controlled.
- Activation MUST follow successful dependency resolution.
- Runtime contracts MUST be injected during activation.
- Capabilities MUST become ready before receiving work.
- Activation SHOULD remain observable.
- Independent capabilities SHOULD activate concurrently where safe.
- Activation failures MUST leave the Runtime in a consistent state.
- Core and extension capabilities MUST activate identically.

---

# Relationship to MEG

Dependency Resolution answers:

> **Can this capability participate?**

Activation answers:

> **Make this capability operational.**

The next chapter introduces the **Extension Lifecycle**, describing how capabilities evolve through installation, activation, execution, upgrade, deactivation and eventual removal while remaining first-class Runtime participants.

---

# Summary

Activation is the bridge between architecture and execution.

It transforms a validated capability into a live participant within the Runtime while preserving:

- dependency correctness
- Runtime stability
- operational visibility
- architectural consistency

Within Mosaic, activation should never be surprising.

Every capability should become operational through the same deterministic, observable process regardless of whether it originated from Core or from a third-party extension.
