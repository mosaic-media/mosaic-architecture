# Dependency Resolution

> *Registration records dependencies. Dependency Resolution determines whether the platform can actually exist.*

---

# Purpose

After discovery and registration, the Runtime possesses a complete catalogue of capabilities.

However, knowing which capabilities exist is insufficient.

The Runtime must determine whether:

- required capabilities exist
- versions are compatible
- contracts are satisfied
- dependency cycles are absent
- activation is possible

This process is known as **Dependency Resolution**.

Dependency Resolution transforms a collection of registered capabilities into a coherent, executable platform.

---

# Philosophy

Within Mosaic:

> **The Runtime should reject an invalid platform before executing a valid capability.**

Capability execution should never begin while dependency uncertainty exists.

Validation belongs before activation.

Not during execution.

---

# Dependency Resolution Pipeline

Every Runtime follows the same dependency pipeline.

```
Registered Capabilities

↓

Dependency Graph

↓

Version Validation

↓

Contract Resolution

↓

Cycle Detection

↓

Activation Order

↓

Ready
```

Execution has still not begun.

The Runtime now knows whether the platform is architecturally valid.

---

# Why Dependency Resolution Exists

Suppose:

```
Recommendations

↓

Playback

↓

Metadata
```

If:

```
Metadata

↓

Missing
```

The Runtime should reject the platform.

Not:

```
Recommendations

↓

Runtime Failure
```

Dependency failures should be detected during startup.

Not during execution.

---

# Required Dependencies

Every required dependency MUST exist.

Example.

```yaml
dependencies:

  playback: ">=2.0.0"

  metadata: "^1.5.0"
```

Missing required dependencies MUST prevent activation.

The Runtime should fail fast.

---

# Optional Dependencies

Optional dependencies do not prevent activation.

Example.

```yaml
optionalDependencies:

  machine-learning: "^1.0.0"
```

If present:

Additional functionality becomes available.

If absent:

The capability continues operating.

The Runtime should clearly distinguish between:

- required
- optional

dependencies.

---

# Version Resolution

The Runtime MUST validate version compatibility.

Example.

```
Metadata

↓

Requires

↓

Playback >=2.0.0
```

If:

```
Playback

↓

1.8.0
```

Activation fails.

Version incompatibility should never be discovered during execution.

---

# Contract Resolution

Capabilities declare:

```yaml
provides:

  - MetadataProvider
```

and

```yaml
consumes:

  - MetadataProvider
```

The Runtime resolves these contracts.

Every required contract MUST be satisfied before activation.

Capabilities should depend upon contracts.

Not implementations.

---

# Capability Graph

Dependency Resolution constructs a Capability Graph.

Example.

```
Library

↓

Metadata

↓

Playback

↓

Recommendations
```

This graph becomes the authoritative model for:

- activation
- startup
- shutdown
- diagnostics

It is distinct from the Runtime Dependency Graph defined in MEG-005.

The Runtime Graph describes Runtime Services.

The Capability Graph describes platform capabilities.

---

# Cycle Detection

The Capability Graph MUST remain acyclic.

Valid.

```
Library

↓

Metadata

↓

Recommendations
```

Invalid.

```
Metadata

↓

Recommendations

↓

Metadata
```

Circular capability dependencies should prevent activation.

Dependency resolution commonly relies on topological sorting with cycle detection to ensure plugins load only after their dependencies are satisfied.  [oai_citation:0‡Hexdocs](https://hexdocs.pm/raxol_core/Raxol.Core.Runtime.Plugins.DependencyResolver.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

# Topological Ordering

Once validated, the Runtime performs a topological sort.

Example.

```
Library

↓

Metadata

↓

Playback

↓

Recommendations
```

Activation should follow this ordering automatically.

No manually maintained activation order should exist.

The dependency graph is authoritative.

---

# Dependency States

Each dependency relationship should resolve to one of:

```
Satisfied
```

```
Optional Missing
```

```
Missing
```

```
Version Conflict
```

```
Cycle Detected
```

Only:

```
Satisfied
```

and

```
Optional Missing
```

allow activation to continue.

---

# Multiple Providers

A contract MAY have multiple providers.

Example.

```
MetadataProvider

├── TMDB

├── AniList

└── Local Metadata
```

Selection policy belongs to Runtime configuration.

Dependency Resolution simply verifies that at least one compatible provider exists.

Resolution should remain deterministic.

---

# Conflicts

Capabilities MAY declare conflicts.

Example.

```yaml
conflicts:

  - legacy-metadata
```

Conflicting capabilities should not activate simultaneously.

The Runtime should reject incompatible platform configurations before execution begins.

Modern plugin systems often validate both dependency and conflict declarations before computing load order.  [oai_citation:1‡Hexdocs](https://hexdocs.pm/raxol_core/Raxol.Core.Runtime.Plugins.DependencyResolver.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

# Capability Groups

The Runtime MAY support grouped capabilities.

Example.

```
Metadata

├── TMDB

├── FanArt

└── Local Artwork
```

The group activates only if all required internal dependencies are satisfied.

Grouping remains a Runtime convenience.

Individual capabilities remain independently versioned.

---

# Incremental Resolution

The Runtime SHOULD support incremental dependency resolution.

Example.

```
New Capability Installed

↓

Resolve New Dependencies

↓

Validate Graph

↓

Activate
```

The Runtime should avoid rebuilding the entire platform graph unnecessarily.

Only affected portions should require re-evaluation.

Incremental dependency resolution is a common optimisation for plugin platforms that support runtime installation.  [oai_citation:2‡Hexdocs](https://hexdocs.pm/raxol_core/Raxol.Core.Runtime.Plugins.DependencyResolver.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

# Failure Reporting

Dependency failures should be explicit.

Examples.

```
Missing Dependency

↓

metadata >=2.0.0
```

```
Version Conflict

↓

playback ^3.0.0

installed 2.7.0
```

Operators should immediately understand:

- what failed
- why
- which capability caused it

Hidden dependency failures complicate operations.

---

# Diagnostics

The Runtime SHOULD expose:

- resolved dependency graph
- activation order
- optional dependencies
- missing dependencies
- version conflicts
- contract providers

Dependency Resolution should become a first-class diagnostic capability.

---

# Runtime Behaviour

Dependency Resolution belongs exclusively to startup and capability installation.

Capabilities should never:

- resolve dependencies
- locate providers
- negotiate versions

Those responsibilities belong entirely to the Runtime.

---

# Security

Dependency Resolution should occur before permission evaluation.

The Runtime should first determine:

> **Can this platform exist?**

Only afterwards should it determine:

> **May these capabilities execute?**

Each stage owns one concern.

---

# Anti-Patterns

The following practices are prohibited.

## Runtime Discovery

Capabilities searching for dependencies during execution.

---

## Manual Activation Order

Hard-coded capability startup ordering.

---

## Silent Version Downgrade

Automatically accepting incompatible versions.

---

## Circular Dependencies

Capability dependency cycles.

---

## Hidden Contracts

Capabilities depending upon undeclared Runtime contracts.

---

## Runtime Guessing

The Runtime selecting arbitrary providers without deterministic rules.

---

# Mosaic Guidelines

Within Mosaic:

- Every required dependency MUST be satisfied before activation.
- Version compatibility MUST be validated.
- Contract providers MUST be resolved explicitly.
- Capability graphs MUST remain acyclic.
- Activation order MUST be derived from the graph.
- Optional dependencies MUST remain explicitly identified.
- Dependency failures MUST remain observable.
- Dependency Resolution MUST complete before activation begins.

---

# Relationship to MEG

Registration answers:

> **Which capabilities belong to this Runtime?**

Dependency Resolution answers:

> **Can those capabilities operate together?**

The next chapter introduces **Activation**, where a validated capability graph becomes a living part of the Runtime and begins participating in platform execution.

---

# Summary

Dependency Resolution is the Runtime's architectural gatekeeper.

It ensures that every capability entering execution does so within a platform that is:

- complete
- compatible
- deterministic
- internally consistent

By validating the platform before executing it, the Mosaic Runtime avoids an entire class of operational failures and preserves one of its core principles:

> **The Runtime should understand the platform completely before it begins executing it.**
