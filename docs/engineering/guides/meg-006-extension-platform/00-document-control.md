# Purpose

This document establishes the governance, authority and lifecycle of the Mosaic Extension Platform specification.

MEG-006 defines how independently developed capabilities become part of the Mosaic platform.

Unlike Runtime Architecture, which defines **how capabilities execute**, this specification defines:

- how capabilities are discovered
- how they are described
- how they are validated
- how they become operational

The Extension Platform is the mechanism through which the platform evolves without modifying Core.

---

# Authority

MEG-006 is the authoritative specification governing extension development throughout the Mosaic ecosystem.

This specification applies to:

- Core Capabilities
- First-party Extensions
- Third-party Extensions
- Enterprise Extensions
- SDK Development
- Marketplace Integration

Every capability intended to execute within the Mosaic Runtime SHOULD comply with this specification.

---

# Relationship to Other Specifications

MEG specifications intentionally build upon one another.

Specifically:

- **MEG-001** defines engineering.
- **MEG-002** defines runtime behaviour.
- **MEG-003** defines business modelling.
- **MEG-004** defines architectural boundaries.
- **MEG-005** defines the Capability Runtime.
- **MEG-006** defines how capabilities join that Runtime.

Together they establish the complete lifecycle of a Mosaic capability.

# Normative Language

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the following keywords are interpreted according to RFC 2119.

| Keyword | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **MUST** | Mandatory requirement. |
| **MUST NOT** | Prohibited behaviour. |
| **SHOULD** | Strong recommendation. Deviation requires architectural justification. |
| **SHOULD NOT** | Discouraged except where clearly justified. |
| **MAY** | Optional behaviour based upon engineering judgement. |

Examples and diagrams are informative unless explicitly identified as normative.

# Extension Principles

The Mosaic Extension Platform is built upon several foundational principles.

- Everything beyond the Runtime is a capability.
- Every capability is described by a manifest.
- Discovery precedes execution.
- Validation precedes activation.
- Runtime stability takes precedence over extension flexibility.
- Capabilities remain independently deployable.
- Core and third-party capabilities are architectural equals.
- Extensions evolve the platform without modifying the Runtime.

Every subsequent chapter expands one or more of these principles.

# Document Lifecycle

MEG specifications evolve alongside the platform.

Each document progresses through the following lifecycle.

```

Accepted specifications become part of the canonical Mosaic architecture.

Historical revisions SHOULD remain available for future reference.

# Platform Evolution

The Extension Platform is expected to evolve.

However, changes affecting:

- capability manifests
- registration
- discovery
- dependency resolution
- permissions
- activation
- SDK contracts

SHOULD be accompanied by an Architectural Decision Record (ADR).

Platform evolution should remain deliberate and predictable.

---

# Compliance

All extensions intended for the Mosaic Runtime SHOULD comply with MEG-006.

Where deviation becomes necessary, extension authors SHOULD document:

- architectural reason
- compatibility impact
- migration strategy
- operational implications

The Runtime should remain capable of validating compliance before activation.

---

# Design Philosophy

MEG-006 intentionally favours:

- manifest-driven discovery
- explicit capability contracts
- deterministic loading
- dependency validation
- runtime isolation
- version compatibility
- operational transparency

The Runtime should understand an extension completely before executing it.

A machine-readable manifest describing identity, dependencies, permissions and capabilities has become the dominant approach for modern extension ecosystems because it enables validation and discovery before code execution.

# Scope of Authority

MEG-006 governs the Extension Platform.

It does **not** define:

- business modelling
- runtime execution
- storage architecture
- deployment topology

Those concerns belong to other MEG specifications.

Keeping extension concerns separate from runtime concerns allows both to evolve independently.
