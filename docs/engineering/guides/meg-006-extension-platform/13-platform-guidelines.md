# Platform Guidelines

> *The platform should become larger by adding capabilities, not by increasing the complexity of the Runtime.*

---

# Purpose

The previous chapters introduced the building blocks of the Extension Platform:

- Capability Manifests
- Discovery
- Registration
- Dependency Resolution
- Activation
- Lifecycle
- SDK
- Permissions
- Configuration
- Versioning
- Isolation

This document brings those concepts together into practical engineering guidance.

Its purpose is to answer one question.

> **"How should I design a new capability for the Mosaic platform?"**

---

# Philosophy

Within Mosaic:

> **Think like a platform engineer, not an application developer.**

Capabilities should be designed as:

- independent
- replaceable
- discoverable
- observable

The Runtime should require no modification to support them.

---

# Start With The Capability

Before writing code ask:

- What business capability exists?
- What problem does it solve?
- Does this belong in an existing capability?
- Should this become a new capability?

Avoid creating capabilities around:

- technical implementation
- frameworks
- storage technologies

Capabilities should model business value.

Not infrastructure.

---

# Design Around Contracts

Every capability should expose:

- contracts
- events
- configuration
- permissions

before implementation begins.

The Runtime should understand:

> **What the capability is**

before understanding:

> **How it is implemented**

---

# Manifest First

Every capability begins with:

```
capability.yaml
```

Before implementation ask:

- What permissions are required?
- Which contracts are provided?
- Which contracts are consumed?
- Which Runtime services are needed?

If the manifest cannot describe the capability clearly:

The design probably requires refinement.

---

# Prefer Small Capabilities

Good.

```
Metadata
```

```
Books
```

```
Playback
```

Poor.

```
MediaEverythingCapability
```

Capabilities should own one coherent business concern.

Large capabilities become miniature monoliths.

---

# Avoid Runtime Knowledge

Capabilities should never know:

- worker count
- scheduler implementation
- dependency graph
- execution engine
- Runtime Kernel

They should know only:

- SDK
- contracts
- business behaviour

The Runtime exists to hide operational complexity.

---

# Runtime Contracts

When consuming Runtime functionality ask:

> **Does a Runtime contract already exist?**

Avoid introducing new Runtime APIs unnecessarily.

The SDK should remain:

- small
- stable
- expressive

The Runtime should evolve underneath it.

---

# Events Before Coupling

Suppose one capability needs another.

Poor.

```
Playback

↓

Recommendation Implementation
```

Preferred.

```
PlaybackCompleted

↓

Runtime

↓

Recommendations
```

Capabilities should collaborate through:

- contracts
- events

Never implementation.

---

# Configuration

Capabilities should declare:

- configuration schema
- defaults
- validation requirements

They should never:

- read files
- parse YAML
- inspect environment variables

Configuration belongs to the Runtime.

---

# Permissions

Capabilities should request:

only

the permissions they require.

Avoid.

```yaml
permissions:

  - runtime.*
```

Prefer.

```yaml
permissions:

  - scheduler.use

  - blob.read
```

The principle of least privilege should guide every capability.

---

# Versioning

Before releasing a capability ask:

- Has a Runtime contract changed?
- Has configuration changed?
- Has behaviour changed?
- Is this backwards compatible?

Version numbers communicate compatibility.

Not development effort.

---

# Dependencies

Declare every dependency explicitly.

Never assume:

- Core capability exists
- SDK feature exists
- Runtime contract exists

The Runtime validates dependency graphs.

Capabilities should not discover missing dependencies during execution.

---

# Build For Replacement

Ask:

> **Could another capability replace this one?**

Examples.

```
TMDB Metadata
```

↓

```
AniList Metadata
```

The Runtime should require only:

- different manifest
- different capability

Everything else should remain unchanged.

Replaceability is one of the defining characteristics of a healthy capability platform.

---

# Build For Discovery

Capabilities should be understandable through their manifest.

Operators should be able to answer:

- What does this capability provide?
- Which permissions does it require?
- Which contracts does it expose?
- Which events does it publish?

without reading source code.

Discovery should become a platform feature.

Not a documentation exercise.

---

# Design For Tooling

Remember:

The Runtime is not the only consumer of manifests.

Tooling may use manifests for:

- marketplace listings
- dependency graphs
- architecture diagrams
- configuration UIs
- compatibility reports

The manifest should remain sufficiently rich to support these tools.

---

# Design For Testing

Every capability should be testable using:

- fake Runtime context
- fake contracts
- fake configuration

The full Runtime should not be required.

Capabilities should remain independently testable.

---

# Design For Isolation

Ask:

> **If this capability fails, what else fails?**

The ideal answer is:

```
Nothing
```

Failures should remain local.

Capability isolation should always outweigh implementation convenience.

---

# Runtime Independence

The Runtime should never change because of one capability.

Poor.

```
New Capability

↓

Modify Runtime
```

Preferred.

```
New Capability

↓

Manifest

↓

Runtime Discovers

↓

Runtime Executes
```

Platform growth should occur through capability addition.

Not Runtime modification.

---

# Marketplace Readiness

A capability should be installable by someone who has never seen its source code.

That requires:

- good manifest
- documentation
- configuration schema
- permissions
- compatibility information

Marketplace readiness should become a natural consequence of good platform design.

---

# Platform Review Checklist

Before implementing a capability confirm:

- [ ] The capability models one business concern.
- [ ] A manifest exists before implementation.
- [ ] Runtime contracts are explicit.
- [ ] Permissions follow least privilege.
- [ ] Configuration schema is complete.
- [ ] Dependencies are declared.
- [ ] Events reinforce loose coupling.
- [ ] The capability is independently testable.
- [ ] The Runtime requires no modification.

---

# Common Platform Mistakes

Avoid:

- extending the Runtime for business features
- hidden dependencies
- Runtime implementation imports
- oversized capabilities
- broad permissions
- undocumented contracts
- implicit configuration

These decisions usually weaken the platform long before they become visible.

---

# Mosaic Guidelines

Within Mosaic:

- Every new feature SHOULD begin as a capability.
- Runtime modification SHOULD be the exception.
- Capabilities MUST remain independently deployable.
- Runtime contracts SHOULD remain explicit.
- Platform growth SHOULD occur through composition.
- Manifests SHOULD remain the primary architectural contract.
- Capability isolation SHOULD remain a design priority.
- Platform simplicity SHOULD always outweigh convenience.

---

# Relationship to MEG

This chapter completes the practical implementation guidance of MEG-006.

The remaining documents describe:

- architectural reasoning (ADRs)
- contributor expectations
- terminology
- references

Together, MEG-001 through MEG-006 now define:

- engineering
- execution
- business modelling
- architecture
- runtime
- platform evolution

The remaining MEGs build upon these foundations rather than redefining them.

---

# Summary

The Extension Platform succeeds when new capabilities feel ordinary.

Installing:

- Books
- Music
- Anime
- Comics
- IPTV

should require no Runtime redesign.

Only:

- discovery
- registration
- activation

Within Mosaic, the Runtime should remain stable for years while capabilities continue to evolve indefinitely.

That is the defining characteristic of a true platform.
