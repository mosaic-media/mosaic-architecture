# Glossary

> *Architecture succeeds when every engineer means the same thing by the same word.*

---

# Purpose

This glossary defines the terminology used throughout the Mosaic Hexagonal Architecture specification.

These definitions establish the canonical architectural vocabulary for:

- Architecture Specifications
- ADRs
- Source Code
- Documentation
- Extension SDKs
- Engineering Discussions

Where a term has a specific meaning within the Mosaic Architecture, that definition takes precedence over informal usage.

---

# A

## Adapter

An infrastructure component that translates between the Domain and an external technology.

Adapters implement Ports.

They own:

- translation
- protocol conversion
- infrastructure integration

They do **not** own business behaviour.

---

## Application Layer

The layer immediately outside the Domain responsible for coordinating business use cases.

Application Services belong to this layer.

The Application Layer orchestrates.

The Domain decides.

---

## Application Service

A component responsible for coordinating a business use case.

Application Services:

- load Aggregates
- invoke business behaviour
- persist changes

They do not implement business rules.

---

# C

## Composition Root

The single location where:

- infrastructure
- adapters
- application services
- runtime

are assembled into a running application.

Typically:

```
cmd/server/main.go
```

The Composition Root owns dependency construction.

---

# D

## Dependency Direction

The architectural rule stating that every dependency points towards the Domain.

Infrastructure depends upon the Domain.

The Domain depends upon nothing external.

---

## Domain

The business core of the application.

The Domain owns:

- Entities
- Aggregates
- Value Objects
- Domain Services
- Domain Events

The Domain remains completely independent of infrastructure.

---

## Driven Adapter

An Adapter implementing a Driven Port.

Examples include:

- PostgreSQL Repository
- TMDB Metadata Provider
- Blob Storage Adapter

Driven Adapters fulfil Domain requests.

---

## Driven Port

A Port describing a capability required by the Domain.

Examples include:

- Repository
- Metadata Provider
- Artwork Store

The Domain owns these contracts.

Infrastructure implements them.

---

## Driving Adapter

An Adapter translating external requests into Domain behaviour.

Examples include:

- HTTP Controllers
- CLI Commands
- Runtime Subscribers
- Scheduler Tasks

Driving Adapters invoke Driving Ports.

---

## Driving Port

A contract describing business behaviour exposed by the Application.

Examples include:

- Resume Playback
- Import Media
- Create Collection

Driving Ports define use cases.

Not transport protocols.

---

# H

## Hexagon

The conceptual boundary surrounding the Domain and Application.

Everything inside the Hexagon represents business behaviour.

Everything outside represents infrastructure.

The hexagon is a visual metaphor rather than a structural requirement.  [oai_citation:0‡Alistair Cockburn](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## Hexagonal Architecture

An architectural style introduced by Alistair Cockburn.

Also known as:

- Ports and Adapters

Its central principle is:

> Dependencies point inward.

Business behaviour remains isolated from external technology.

 [oai_citation:1‡Alistair Cockburn](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

# I

## Infrastructure

Everything outside the Domain.

Examples include:

- HTTP
- PostgreSQL
- Blob Storage
- Docker
- Runtime
- External APIs

Infrastructure adapts itself to the Domain.

Never the reverse.

---

# P

## Port

A business contract owned by the Domain or Application Layer.

Ports define:

- required capabilities
- exposed behaviour

Ports never define implementation.

---

# R

## Replaceability

The architectural property whereby one technology may be exchanged for another without modifying business behaviour.

Replaceability is achieved through:

- Ports
- Adapters
- Dependency Inversion

---

## Runtime Boundary

The architectural separation between:

- the Domain Model
- the Reactive Runtime

The Runtime coordinates execution.

The Domain models business behaviour.

---

# T

## Technology Leakage

The accidental introduction of infrastructure concepts into the Domain.

Examples include:

- SQL
- HTTP
- JSON
- Docker
- Runtime APIs

Technology leakage violates Hexagonal Architecture.

---

## Translation

The process performed by Adapters to convert between:

- infrastructure models
- business models

Translation always occurs at the architectural boundary.

Never inside the Domain.

---

# U

## Use Case

A business operation exposed through a Driving Port.

Examples include:

- Import Media
- Resume Playback
- Archive Collection

Application Services coordinate use cases.

Aggregates implement business behaviour.

# Relationship to MEG-004

This glossary supports every document within the Hexagonal Architecture specification.

Definitions should remain consistent across:

- Architecture Specifications
- Runtime Documentation
- Domain Documentation
- Extension SDKs
- Contributor Guidance

Whenever architectural terminology evolves, this glossary SHOULD be updated before introducing new terminology elsewhere.
