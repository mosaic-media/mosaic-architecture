# Purpose

This document lists the primary references that informed the architectural principles described in MEG-010.

The intention is not to mandate specific technologies or implementations, but to acknowledge the engineering literature and platform documentation that influenced the design of Mosaic's performance philosophy.

# Engineering Principle

MEG-010 intentionally favours architectural simplicity over platform-specific optimisation techniques.

Contributors should use measurements, profiling and architectural reasoning to guide performance work rather than relying on folklore or anecdotal "best practices."

---

# Final Statement

Performance within Mosaic is not achieved through isolated optimisation.

It emerges from thousands of small engineering decisions that collectively reduce unnecessary work while preserving correctness, observability and architectural clarity.

The goal is not to build the fastest possible system.

The goal is to build a system that remains fast as it continues to evolve.

Those are very different achievements.

One wins benchmark competitions.

The other survives real users.

---

# Completion

This concludes **MEG-010 — Performance Engineering**.

The principles defined throughout this specification establish how Mosaic should remain efficient, responsive and scalable without compromising the architectural foundations established by previous MEGs.

Subsequent specifications build upon these principles rather than replacing them.
