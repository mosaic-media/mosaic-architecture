# Document Control

---

# Purpose

This document records the control information for MEG-010 and defines how the specification is managed, reviewed, updated and referenced.

Document control exists so that performance guidance does not drift into informal opinion dressed up as architecture.

If performance is going to shape the platform, then the document defining it must be easy to identify, version, maintain and govern.

| Document | MEG-010 |
| Title | Performance Engineering |
| Status | Draft |
| Version | 0.4 |
| Owner | AdamNi-7080 |
| Audience | Contributors, reviewers, maintainers |
| Classification | Engineering specification |
| Scope | Cross-cutting platform performance guidance |

# Document Authority

MEG-010 is a normative engineering specification.

It defines expectations for how performance must be considered across the Mosaic platform.

It is not a suggestion document.

It is not a general essay.

It is not a collection of tuning tricks gathered from the internet by someone who once saw a latency chart and got emotionally involved.

When this document conflicts with local preference, this document takes precedence.

When this document is incomplete, contributors should defer to the architecture already established by the preceding MEGs and raise the gap for review.

---

# Usage Rules

Contributors should treat this document as guidance for:

- design decisions
- implementation choices
- optimisation priorities
- performance review
- profiling targets
- capacity planning
- regression analysis

This document should be consulted when:

- adding new capabilities
- introducing new repositories
- changing storage behaviour
- altering runtime scheduling
- increasing event volume
- modifying caching logic
- evaluating performance regressions
- reviewing performance-sensitive pull requests

Contributors should become familiar with the performance specification before responding to a formal incident.

# Revision History

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 0.1 | Draft | Initial structure and performance architecture outline |
| 0.4 | Draft | Editorial, structural and cross-reference review completed |

Future revisions should record:

- what changed
- why it changed
- which architectural assumption changed
- whether the change affects runtime, storage, or observability expectations
- whether the change requires updates to related MEGs

---

# Review and Approval

MEG-010 must be reviewed by contributors with architectural responsibility for:

- runtime behaviour
- capability execution
- storage design
- observability
- security impact
- platform performance

Approval indicates that the document is coherent with the existing engineering model and suitable for use as platform guidance.

Approval does not mean the platform is already fast.

It means the roadmap for making it fast is sane.

# Maintenance Rules

The document owner is responsible for ensuring that:

- terminology remains consistent
- chapter ordering remains intact
- dependencies remain accurate
- additions do not duplicate other MEGs
- examples remain aligned with the current architecture
- obsolete guidance is removed rather than left to fossilise like a forgotten internal wiki page

Changes should be made deliberately.

Performance guidance that shifts too often becomes noise.
