# Purpose

This document establishes the governance, authority and lifecycle of the Mosaic Runtime Architecture specification.

MEG-005 defines the internal architecture of the Mosaic Runtime.

Unlike [MEG-002](../meg-002-event-driven-runtime/index.md), which defines **runtime behaviour**, this specification defines the **components, responsibilities and relationships** that make the runtime possible.

It answers:

> **What is the Runtime made of?**

Not:

> **How does the Runtime behave?**

Version 0.4 records the Supervisor Build Pipeline as an isolated runtime composition and activation flow.

---

# Authority

MEG-005 is the authoritative specification governing the internal architecture of the Mosaic Runtime.

This specification applies to:

- Mosaic Platform
- Runtime Kernel
- Capability Registry
- Execution Engine
- Scheduler
- Supervisor
- Worker Manager
- Resource Management
- Runtime Bootstrap

Every runtime component SHOULD conform to the structural principles defined within this specification.

---

# Relationship to Other Specifications

MEG specifications intentionally build upon one another.

N1["MDL"]
N2["MDS"]

N7["MEG-005"]

```

Specifically:

- **[MEG-001](../meg-001-go-engineering-standards/index.md)** defines engineering.
- **[MEG-002](../meg-002-event-driven-runtime/index.md)** defines runtime behaviour.
- **[MEG-003](../meg-003-domain-driven-design/index.md)** defines business modelling.
- **[MEG-004](../meg-004-hexagonal-architecture/index.md)** defines dependency boundaries.
- **MEG-005** defines runtime structure.

Together they describe both **how** the platform behaves and **how** it is constructed.

# Normative Language

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the following keywords are interpreted according to RFC 2119.

| Keyword | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **MUST** | Mandatory requirement. |
| **MUST NOT** | Prohibited behaviour. |
| **SHOULD** | Strong recommendation. Deviation requires architectural justification. |
| **SHOULD NOT** | Discouraged except where clearly justified. |
| **MAY** | Optional behaviour based upon engineering judgement. |

Examples and diagrams are informative unless explicitly identified as normative.

# Runtime Principles

The Mosaic Runtime is built upon several foundational principles.

- The Runtime owns execution.
- Capabilities own business behaviour.
- Every runtime component owns one responsibility.
- Resources have explicit ownership.
- Lifecycle is deterministic.
- Dependencies remain explicit.
- Components communicate through contracts.
- Runtime services remain independently replaceable.

Every subsequent chapter expands one or more of these principles.

---

# Document Lifecycle

MEG specifications evolve alongside the platform.

Each document progresses through the following lifecycle.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

N1["Draft"]
N2["Review"]
N3["Accepted"]
N4["Implemented"]
N5["Maintained"]
N6["Superseded (optional)"]

N1 --> N2
N2 --> N3
N3 --> N4
N4 --> N5
N5 --> N6
```

Accepted specifications become part of the canonical Mosaic architecture.

Historical revisions SHOULD remain available for future reference.

---

# Runtime Evolution

The Runtime is expected to evolve.

However, structural changes should remain deliberate.

Changes affecting:

- Runtime Kernel
- Capability Registry
- Execution Engine
- Scheduler
- Resource ownership
- Service lifecycle
- Startup sequence

SHOULD be accompanied by an Architectural Decision Record (ADR).

Runtime architecture should evolve through intentional engineering rather than incremental drift.

---

# Compliance

All runtime repositories SHOULD comply with MEG-005.

Where deviation becomes necessary, repositories SHOULD document:

- architectural reason
- affected components
- migration strategy
- expected impact

Temporary deviations should eventually be removed.

Permanent deviations should generally result in updates to this specification.

---

# Design Philosophy

MEG-005 intentionally favours:

- modularity
- explicit ownership
- deterministic lifecycle
- replaceable components
- operational simplicity
- clear dependency direction

The Runtime should resemble a small operating system.

Each component should own exactly one responsibility.

Complex behaviour should emerge from cooperation between small runtime services rather than from one large coordinating component.

This reflects well-established operating system design principles in which the kernel provides foundational execution, scheduling and resource management while higher-level services remain modular and independently evolvable.

# Scope of Authority

MEG-005 governs runtime architecture.

It does **not** define:

- business domains
- domain behaviour
- runtime semantics
- storage implementation
- module SDKs

Those concerns belong to:

- [MEG-002](../meg-002-event-driven-runtime/index.md)
- [MEG-003](../meg-003-domain-driven-design/index.md)
- [MEG-004](../meg-004-hexagonal-architecture/index.md)
- future MEG specifications

Maintaining this separation keeps structural concerns independent from behavioural concerns.
