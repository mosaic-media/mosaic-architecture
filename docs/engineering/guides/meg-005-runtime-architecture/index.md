# MEG-005 — Runtime Architecture

> *The Runtime is not a collection of services. It is the operating system of the Mosaic platform.*

---

# Purpose

Previous engineering specifications established:

- how software is written
- how the runtime behaves
- how the business is modelled
- how technology is isolated from the business

MEG-005 answers a different question.

> **How is the Runtime itself constructed?**

The Mosaic Runtime is more than an event bus.

It is responsible for:

- capability discovery
- dependency composition
- lifecycle management
- scheduling
- execution
- orchestration
- observability
- resource ownership

This document defines the internal architecture of the Runtime itself.

Unlike MEG-002, which describes **runtime behaviour**, MEG-005 describes **runtime structure**.

# Scope

This specification defines:

- Runtime philosophy
- Runtime composition
- Platform runtime components
- Capability registry
- Service lifecycle
- Dependency graph
- Execution engine
- Worker manager
- Scheduler architecture
- Resource ownership
- Capability discovery
- Startup architecture
- Shutdown architecture
- Runtime state
- Runtime extensibility

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- Domain modelling
- Business behaviour
- Event semantics
- Module SDKs
- Storage implementation

Those concerns belong to other MEG specifications.

# Guiding Question

MEG-005 exists to answer one question.

> **How should the Mosaic Runtime itself be architected so that it remains modular, resilient and extensible?**

---

# Runtime Statement

Within Mosaic:

> **The Runtime is an execution platform, not a business platform.**

The Runtime exists to provide capabilities with an execution environment.

It owns:

- execution
- coordination
- lifecycle
- resources

It does **not** own:

- playback
- metadata
- libraries
- recommendations
- users

Business belongs to capabilities.

Execution belongs to the Runtime.

---

# Runtime Hierarchy

The Runtime intentionally separates itself into architectural layers.

```
Bootstrap

↓

Runtime Kernel

↓

Capability Registry

↓

Execution Engine

↓

Schedulers

↓

Workers

↓

Capabilities

↓

Business
```

Each layer owns exactly one responsibility.

The Runtime should resemble a small operating system.

Not a large application.

---

# Expected Outcome

After reading MEG-005 contributors should understand:

- how the Runtime is internally organised
- how capabilities are discovered
- how services start
- how workers are managed
- how scheduling integrates with execution
- how dependencies are resolved
- how resources are owned
- how the Runtime evolves without becoming a monolith

without discussing individual business capabilities.

# Dependencies

Required reading:

- MEG-001 Go Engineering Standards
- MEG-002 Reactive Runtime
- MEG-003 Domain-Driven Design
- MEG-004 Hexagonal Architecture

Future companion specifications:

- MEG-006 Module Platform
- MEG-007 Storage Architecture
- MEG-008 Observability

---

# Design Goals

The Runtime Architecture is intended to produce a platform that is:

- Modular
- Observable
- Deterministic
- Extensible
- Replaceable
- Resource aware
- Fault tolerant
- Operationally simple

The Runtime should feel more like a lightweight operating system than a traditional backend application.

Every new capability should integrate into the Runtime rather than modifying it.
