# Purpose

This document establishes the governance, authority and lifecycle of the Mosaic Security Architecture specification.

MEG-009 defines the architectural principles governing trust throughout the Mosaic platform.

Unlike previous specifications, which define:

- execution
- storage
- observability
- platform evolution

this specification defines:

> **How the platform decides what can be trusted.**

Security is treated as an architectural concern rather than an implementation feature.

Every Runtime decision should reinforce explicit trust boundaries.

---

# Authority

MEG-009 is the authoritative specification governing security throughout the Mosaic platform.

This specification applies to:

- Runtime Kernel
- Runtime Services
- Capabilities
- Extension Platform
- Storage Systems
- SDK
- Administrative APIs
- Marketplace Integration

Every architectural component SHOULD conform to the trust model defined within this specification.

---

# Relationship to Other Specifications

MEG specifications intentionally build upon one another.

Specifically:

- **MEG-001** defines engineering.
- **MEG-002** defines Runtime behaviour.
- **MEG-003** defines business modelling.
- **MEG-004** defines architectural boundaries.
- **MEG-005** defines Runtime Architecture.
- **MEG-006** defines the Extension Platform.
- **MEG-007** defines Storage Architecture.
- **MEG-008** defines Observability.
- **MEG-009** defines trust, authority and protection.

Together they establish not only how the platform operates, but how it protects that operation.

# Normative Language

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the following keywords are interpreted according to RFC 2119.

| Keyword | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **MUST** | Mandatory requirement. |
| **MUST NOT** | Prohibited behaviour. |
| **SHOULD** | Strong recommendation. Deviation requires architectural justification. |
| **SHOULD NOT** | Discouraged except where clearly justified. |
| **MAY** | Optional behaviour based upon engineering judgement. |

Examples and diagrams are informative unless explicitly identified as normative.

# Security Principles

The Mosaic Security Architecture is built upon several foundational principles.

- Trust is explicit.
- Authority is least privilege.
- Capabilities begin untrusted.
- Runtime boundaries enforce security.
- Identity precedes authority.
- Permissions describe capability.
- Secrets remain Runtime owned.
- Observability supports security.
- Security follows architecture.

Every subsequent chapter expands one or more of these principles.

# Document Lifecycle

MEG specifications evolve alongside the platform.

Each document progresses through the following lifecycle.

```text
Draft

↓

Review

↓

Accepted

↓

Implemented

↓

Maintained

↓

Superseded (optional)
```

Accepted specifications become part of the canonical Mosaic architecture.

Historical revisions SHOULD remain available for future reference.

# Security Evolution

Security Architecture is expected to evolve.

However, changes affecting:

- trust boundaries
- authentication
- authorisation
- permission model
- extension trust
- secret handling
- cryptographic policy

SHOULD be accompanied by an Architectural Decision Record (ADR).

Security changes should remain deliberate.

Never opportunistic.

---

# Compliance

All Runtime components SHOULD comply with MEG-009.

Where deviation becomes necessary, contributors SHOULD document:

- architectural reason
- affected trust boundaries
- operational impact
- migration strategy

Security exceptions should remain temporary wherever practical.

---

# Design Philosophy

MEG-009 intentionally favours:

- explicit trust
- least privilege
- defence in depth
- architectural isolation
- deterministic security
- operational transparency

Security should emerge naturally from the architecture already established throughout the previous MEGs.

It should not become a parallel system competing with Runtime ownership.

---

# Scope of Authority

MEG-009 governs:

- trust
- identity
- authority
- permissions
- secrets
- cryptographic protection

It does **not** define:

- Runtime execution
- storage implementation
- deployment infrastructure
- business behaviour

Those concerns belong to other engineering specifications.

Security protects those systems.

It does not replace them.
