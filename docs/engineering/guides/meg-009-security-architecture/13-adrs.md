# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

> *Security decisions are among the most expensive architectural decisions to reverse. They should always be intentional, documented and historically traceable.*

---

# Purpose

The Security Architecture defines:

- trust
- authority
- permissions
- identity
- confidentiality
- integrity

Changes to these mechanisms affect:

- every Runtime Service
- every capability
- every extension
- every user
- every deployment

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) preserve the reasoning behind those decisions.

Future contributors should understand not only:

> **How the platform protects itself**

but also:

> **Why it protects itself that way.**

---

# Philosophy

Within Mosaic:

> **Security should evolve through deliberate architectural decisions rather than reactive implementation changes.**

Security decisions often survive for years.

Poor decisions become difficult to replace.

Architectural reasoning should therefore remain permanently documented.

---

# Why Security ADRs Matter

Security changes frequently appear small.

Examples include:

- adding a permission
- changing authentication
- modifying trust boundaries
- altering extension validation

In reality, these decisions influence:

- Runtime behaviour
- extension compatibility
- marketplace policy
- operational procedures

Without ADRs, future contributors eventually ask:

- Why do capabilities begin with zero permissions?
- Why does the Runtime own secrets?
- Why are manifests mandatory?
- Why are Core capabilities treated like extensions?

Architectural reasoning should never disappear.

---

# When An ADR Is Required

A Security ADR SHOULD be created whenever a decision changes:

- trust boundaries
- authentication
- authorisation
- permission model
- extension trust
- cryptographic policy
- secret management
- security observability

If the decision changes how trust is established or enforced, it deserves an ADR.

---

# Examples

Examples of Security ADRs include:

```text
ADR-001

Zero Trust Runtime
```

```text
ADR-002

Capability Permission Model
```

```text
ADR-003

Runtime-Owned Secrets
```

```text
ADR-004

Extension Trust Pipeline
```

```text
ADR-005

Security Observability
```

```text
ADR-006

Network Trust Boundaries
```

```text
ADR-007

Cryptographic Strategy
```

```text
ADR-008

Authentication Architecture
```

These decisions define the long-term security posture of the platform.

---

# Security Stability

Security Architecture should evolve conservatively.

Changing:

```text
Password Policy
```

is relatively inexpensive.

Changing:

```text
Trust Model
```

affects:

- permissions
- Runtime behaviour
- extension execution
- marketplace validation
- security observability

Architectural trust boundaries should therefore change only after careful review.

---

# ADR Structure

Every Security ADR SHOULD contain:

```text
Title

↓

Status

↓

Context

↓

Security Problem

↓

Options

↓

Decision

↓

Consequences

↓

Migration

↓

Related Specifications
```

Migration guidance is particularly important because security changes frequently affect deployed systems.

---

# Context

The Context section should describe:

- existing trust model
- Runtime assumptions
- capability behaviour
- operational constraints

Readers unfamiliar with the platform should understand:

> **Why did this security discussion become necessary?**

---

# Security Problem

The problem statement should describe architectural security.

Good.

```text
Capabilities currently receive unnecessary Runtime authority.
```

Poor.

```text
Security feels weak.
```

The problem should remain architectural.

Not emotional or implementation specific.

---

# Options

Every Security ADR SHOULD evaluate alternatives.

Examples.

```text
Runtime-Owned Secrets
```

versus

```text
Capability-Owned Secrets
```

or

```text
Manifest Permissions
```

versus

```text
Runtime Permission Discovery
```

Each option should document:

- advantages
- disadvantages
- operational impact
- maintenance implications

Rejected alternatives remain valuable architectural knowledge.

---

# Decision

The Decision section answers:

> **Which security architecture becomes the Mosaic standard?**

Implementation belongs elsewhere.

The ADR records the architectural commitment.

---

# Consequences

Every security decision introduces trade-offs.

Example.

Choosing:

```text
Least Privilege
```

Benefits.

- reduced attack surface
- improved isolation
- simpler review

Costs.

- additional manifests
- permission management
- Runtime enforcement complexity

Trade-offs should always be documented honestly.

Security always balances:

- usability
- flexibility
- protection

---

# Migration

Security changes frequently require migration.

Migration guidance SHOULD explain:

- affected capabilities
- permission changes
- trust changes
- compatibility implications

Security evolution should remain predictable.

Not surprising.

---

# Trust Evolution

Changes affecting the Runtime Trust Model SHOULD always receive ADRs.

Trust underpins:

- permissions
- authentication
- extension execution
- storage protection

Changing trust changes the platform itself.

---

# Cryptographic Evolution

Cryptographic algorithms inevitably evolve.

Security ADRs SHOULD explain:

- algorithm replacement
- compatibility
- migration
- operational impact

Architecture should remain independent from individual algorithms.

---

# Repository Structure

Recommended layout.

```text
architecture/

    adrs/

        ADR-001-zero-trust-runtime.md

        ADR-002-capability-permissions.md

        ADR-003-runtime-secrets.md

        ADR-004-extension-verification.md

        ADR-005-security-observability.md
```

Security ADRs should remain close to the Security Architecture they explain.

---

# Review Process

Security ADRs SHOULD receive architectural review.

Review should consider:

- trust
- authority
- isolation
- observability
- operational simplicity
- long-term maintainability

Security decisions should strengthen architecture.

Not merely implementation.

---

# Documentation

Accepted Security ADRs SHOULD eventually be reflected within:

- MEG specifications
- Runtime documentation
- SDK documentation
- operational runbooks
- contributor guidance

Security documentation should evolve alongside the platform.

---

# Mosaic Guidelines

Within Mosaic:

- Significant security decisions SHOULD have ADRs.
- Trust boundaries MUST remain documented.
- Alternative approaches SHOULD be evaluated.
- Trade-offs MUST be acknowledged.
- Migration guidance SHOULD accompany security evolution.
- Historical ADRs MUST remain available.
- Security Architecture SHOULD evolve deliberately rather than reactively.

---

# Relationship to MEG

MEG-009 defines:

> **How the platform protects itself today.**

Security ADRs explain:

> **Why those protection mechanisms exist.**

Together they preserve the architectural intent behind every major security decision made throughout the Mosaic platform.

---

# Summary

Security decisions tend to become permanent.

Trust models.

Permission systems.

Authentication.

Cryptography.

These are not implementation details.

They become part of the platform's identity.

Architectural Decision Records ensure that the reasoning behind those decisions remains as durable as the security architecture itself.
