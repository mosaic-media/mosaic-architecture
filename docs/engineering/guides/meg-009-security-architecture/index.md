# MEG-009 — Security Architecture

> *Security is not a collection of features. It is the architectural discipline of deciding what the platform trusts, what it protects and what it refuses to assume.*

---

# Purpose

Previous engineering specifications established:

- how software is written
- how work executes
- how the business is modelled
- how the Domain is protected
- how the Runtime operates
- how the platform evolves
- how information is stored
- how the platform explains itself

MEG-009 answers the next architectural question.

> **How does the platform protect itself while remaining extensible?**

Unlike traditional applications, Mosaic executes:

- Core capabilities
- first-party capabilities
- third-party capabilities
- user configuration
- external APIs
- remote media providers

Security therefore cannot be treated as an implementation detail.

It must become part of the architecture itself.

Previous specifications define:

> **How the platform behaves.**

MEG-009 defines:

> **How the platform remains trustworthy while behaving that way.**

---

# Scope

This specification defines:

- Security philosophy
- Trust model
- Authentication
- Authorisation
- Capability permissions
- Secrets management
- Data protection
- Extension trust
- Network security
- Cryptography
- Security observability
- Security guidelines

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- Runtime execution
- business modelling
- storage implementation
- deployment topology

Those concerns belong to previous or future MEG specifications.

---

# Core Question

MEG-009 exists to answer one question.

> **How should Mosaic protect users, capabilities and information without sacrificing the architectural principles established throughout the previous MEGs?**

---

# Security Statement

Within Mosaic:

> **Every capability begins with zero trust and earns authority through explicit Runtime contracts.**

The platform trusts:

- architectural boundaries
- explicit permissions
- verified identities
- deterministic Runtime behaviour

It does **not** trust:

- arbitrary extension code
- user input
- remote services
- implicit assumptions

Trust should always be:

- explicit
- observable
- reviewable

---

# Security Hierarchy

Security intentionally follows the architecture.

```

Every layer reinforces the next.

Security should emerge naturally from architectural ownership rather than scattered implementation checks.

---

# Expected Outcome

After reading MEG-009 contributors should understand:

- how trust is established
- how identities are verified
- how capabilities receive authority
- how secrets are managed
- how information is protected
- how third-party extensions remain isolated
- how security integrates with every previous MEG

without weakening the capability-oriented architecture.

# Design Goals

The Security Architecture is intended to produce a platform that is:

- Trustworthy
- Least-privileged
- Capability-aware
- Auditable
- Observable
- Extensible
- Replaceable
- Secure by default

Security should reinforce every previous architectural decision rather than introducing a parallel architecture.
