# Debugging

> *Debugging support should explain behaviour without changing it.*

---

# Purpose

MOP-001 defines operational debugging boundaries.

This chapter explains how engineers should provide safe investigation mechanisms.

---

# Engineering Guidance

Debugging features should be reserved for questions that normal observability cannot answer.

If routine operation depends on debugging, observability is incomplete.

---

# Implementation Expectations

Debugging mechanisms should be:

- deterministic
- permission-gated
- observable themselves
- non-invasive
- safe for production use where explicitly allowed
- redacted where sensitive data may appear

They should not bypass Platform authority or expose hidden operational APIs.

---

# Reference

Operational authority is provided by:

- MOP-001 — Observability Operations
