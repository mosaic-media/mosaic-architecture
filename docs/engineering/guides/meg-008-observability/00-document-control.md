# Purpose

This document establishes the governance, authority and lifecycle of the Mosaic Observability specification.

MEG-008 defines how the Mosaic platform exposes operational insight into every architectural layer.

Unlike previous specifications, which define:

- engineering
- runtime
- storage
- capabilities

this specification defines:

> **How those systems become observable.**

Observability is treated as a first-class architectural concern rather than an operational afterthought.

---

# Authority

MEG-008 is the authoritative specification governing observability throughout the Mosaic platform.

This specification applies to:

- Runtime Kernel
- Runtime Services
- Capabilities
- Storage Systems
- Module Platform
- SDK
- Operational Tooling

Every subsystem SHOULD expose operational information in accordance with this specification.

---

# Relationship to Other Specifications

MEG specifications intentionally build upon one another.

Specifically:

- **MEG-001** defines engineering.
- **MEG-002** defines Runtime behaviour.
- **MEG-003** defines business modelling.
- **MEG-004** defines architectural boundaries.
- **MEG-005** defines Runtime Architecture.
- **MEG-006** defines the Module Platform.
- **MEG-007** defines Storage Architecture.
- **MEG-008** defines how every previous architectural layer becomes operationally visible.

Together they describe both how the platform works and how operators understand it.

# Normative Language

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the following keywords are interpreted according to RFC 2119.

| Keyword | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **MUST** | Mandatory requirement. |
| **MUST NOT** | Prohibited behaviour. |
| **SHOULD** | Strong recommendation. Deviation requires architectural justification. |
| **SHOULD NOT** | Discouraged except where clearly justified. |
| **MAY** | Optional behaviour based upon engineering judgement. |

Examples and diagrams are informative unless explicitly identified as normative.

# Observability Principles

The Mosaic Observability Architecture is built upon several foundational principles.

- Every Runtime decision should be observable.
- Every capability should report its operational health.
- Logs describe events.
- Metrics describe trends.
- Traces describe journeys.
- Health describes readiness.
- Diagnostics describe architecture.
- Business behaviour remains separate from operational telemetry.

Every subsequent chapter expands one or more of these principles.

---

# Document Lifecycle

MEG specifications evolve alongside the platform.

Each document progresses through the following lifecycle.

```text
Draft

Accepted

Superseded (optional)
```

Accepted specifications become part of the canonical Mosaic architecture.

Historical revisions SHOULD remain available for future reference.

# Observability Evolution

Observability is expected to evolve.

However, changes affecting:

- logging strategy
- metrics taxonomy
- tracing model
- health model
- diagnostic interfaces
- telemetry contracts

SHOULD be accompanied by an Architectural Decision Record (ADR).

Observability should evolve intentionally.

Not reactively.

---

# Compliance

All Runtime components SHOULD comply with MEG-008.

Where deviation becomes necessary, contributors SHOULD document:

- architectural reason
- affected telemetry
- operational impact
- migration strategy

Observability gaps should remain temporary wherever possible.

---

# Design Philosophy

MEG-008 intentionally favours:

- structured telemetry
- explicit ownership
- low operational ambiguity
- deterministic diagnostics
- platform-wide consistency
- implementation independence

The platform should explain itself through architecture.

Operators should not require source code to understand:

- Runtime behaviour
- capability interactions
- storage health
- platform state

---

# Scope of Authority

MEG-008 governs observability architecture.

It does **not** define:

- business behaviour
- Runtime execution
- storage implementation
- deployment infrastructure

Those concerns belong to previous engineering specifications.

Observability describes those systems.

It does not implement them.
