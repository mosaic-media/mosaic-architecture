# Mosaic

A self-hosted media server that covers every format in one place — music, television, film, anime, comics, manga, audiobooks — without requiring the user to run three separate systems, or to become their own IT support.

This repository holds Mosaic's architecture and direction. The implementation lives across sibling repositories: the Platform ([`mosaic-platform`](https://github.com/mosaic-media/mosaic-platform)), the published SDK modules build against ([`mosaic-sdk`](https://github.com/mosaic-media/mosaic-sdk)), optional modules in their own repositories (the first is [`mosaic-module-stremio`](https://github.com/mosaic-media/mosaic-module-stremio)), the Shell (the server-driven web client, [`mosaic-shell`](https://github.com/mosaic-media/mosaic-shell)), and the Server-Driven-UI contract those share ([`mosaic-sdui`](https://github.com/mosaic-media/mosaic-sdui)).

## Read these

Published at **[mosaic-media.github.io/mosaic-architecture](https://mosaic-media.github.io/mosaic-architecture/)**, where every page is also downloadable as a PDF.

| Page | What it answers |
|---|---|
| **[Mosaic](docs/index.md)** | What Mosaic is, why it exists, what has been decided, and what has deliberately not been |
| **[Architecture](docs/architecture.md)** | How the platform is built. Written from the source, not from a plan |
| **[Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)** | What is being built next, and what is blocking it |
| **[Decisions](docs/adr/)** | Architecture decision records |

Three pages and a numbered series of decision records. That is the whole repository.

## How this repository works

**Code is authoritative.** Where `mosaic-platform` has built something, the code decides and these documents describe it. They do not specify it in advance and they do not contradict it. If a document disagrees with the source, the document is wrong.

**Documentation follows implementation.** Roadmaps may look forward; descriptions of the system may not. Documentation written for unbuilt software has nothing pushing back on it, which is how contradictions survive indefinitely.

**Superseded content is deleted, not annotated.** Git keeps every abandoned idea permanently, so deleting costs nothing and leaving stale material costs a great deal. A note saying "this section is out of date" does not outweigh the pages around it that still assert the old thing.

**One authoritative statement per fact.** If two documents answer the same question, a reader picks one, and the choice is arbitrary.

## History

This repository previously held over two hundred specification documents under a bespoke taxonomy — MDL, MDS, MEG, MAC, MIP, MOP, MAD, MDP. Most of it was generated across many AI sessions and never validated. It accumulated contradictions faster than anyone could resolve them, and eventually began producing wrong work: a roadmap built against a storage model that had been abandoned, and a transport layer the architecture explicitly forbids.

The cause was structural. The repository was serving as both memory across sessions and source of truth, and those want opposite things — memory accumulates, truth replaces. Memory won by volume, so abandoned ideas were retrieved as current architecture.

The full prior corpus is preserved at tag `pre-reset-2026-07-19` and can be recovered in whole or in part at any time.

`docs/` was rebuilt from scratch after the reset. It now holds the current, authoritative documentation — the three pages and the ADRs linked above — and nothing of the old taxonomy remains in it.
