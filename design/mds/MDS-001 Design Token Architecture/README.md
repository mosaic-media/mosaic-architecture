# MDS-001 — Design Token Architecture

> *Tokens are not values. They are the language through which the Design System communicates intent.*

---

# Purpose

The Mosaic Design Language (MDL) establishes:

- Why Mosaic exists.
- How decisions are made.
- How the platform thinks.
- How the platform behaves.
- How understanding is organised.

MDS-001 begins the implementation layer.

It defines how those concepts become a machine-readable design system.

Unlike many design systems, MDS-001 is **not** simply a colour token document.

It defines the architectural hierarchy through which every future Mosaic client will express the same conceptual experience.

Tokens are the first implementation artefact.

Everything beneath MDS-001 depends upon them.

---

# Scope

This specification defines:

- Token philosophy
- Token hierarchy
- Token taxonomy
- Semantic layers
- Runtime token model
- Token inheritance
- Token resolution
- Token lifecycle
- Versioning
- Extension interaction

This specification intentionally does **not** define:

- Colours
- Typography values
- Motion curves
- Components
- Materials

Those are defined by later MDS specifications.

# Core Question

MDS-001 exists to answer one question.

> **How should design decisions become implementation?**

---

# Token Statement

Within Mosaic:

> **Tokens describe intent.**

They do not describe implementation.

For example.

Poor.

```
Blue500
```

Better.

```
Brand.Primary
```

Better still.

```
Surface.Hero
```

The further implementation moves from raw values towards meaning, the easier the system becomes to evolve.

---

# Primary Token Hierarchy

The Mosaic Design System intentionally separates tokens into conceptual layers.

```
Primitive

↓

Semantic

↓

Composition

↓

Component

↓

Runtime

↓

Presentation
```

Each layer has exactly one responsibility.

Future chapters define every layer in detail.

# Expected Outcome

After reading MDS-001 contributors should understand:

- how tokens are organised
- why semantic tokens exist
- why runtime tokens exist
- how components consume tokens
- how extensions interact with tokens
- how future token systems should evolve

without discussing specific colour palettes or component implementations.
